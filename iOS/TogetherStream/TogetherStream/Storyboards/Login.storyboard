International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs

Part 1 - General Terms

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,

* DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND

* PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA AND DOCUMENTATION TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM IT WAS OBTAINED FOR A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT PAID. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.

1. Definitions

"Authorized Use" - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units ("MSUs"), Processor Value Units ("PVUs"), or other level of use specified by IBM.

"IBM" - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") - a document that provides information and any additional terms specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at www.ibm.com/software/sla. The LI can also be found in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet included with the Program.

"Program" - the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, files, and modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).

2. Agreement Structure

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any) and the LI and is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee's use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent of any conflict, the LI prevails over both Parts.

3. License Grant

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.

IBM grants Licensee a nonexclusive license to 1) use the Program up to the Authorized Use specified in the invoice, 2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use, and 3) make a backup copy, all provided that

a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of this Agreement;

b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot execute;

c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program;

d. Licensee ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) 1) does so only on Licensee's behalf and 2) complies with the terms of this Agreement;

e. Licensee does not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program's components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; or 4) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; and

f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item "f," a "Supporting Program" is a Program that is part of another IBM Program ("Principal Program") and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program's LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)

This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.

3.1 Trade-ups, Updates, Fixes, and Patches

3.1.1 Trade-ups

If the Program is replaced by a trade-up Program, the replaced Program's license is promptly terminated.

3.1.2 Updates, Fixes, and Patches

When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.

3.2 Fixed Term Licenses

If IBM licenses the Program for a fixed term, Licensee's license is terminated at the end of the fixed term, unless Licensee and IBM agree to renew it.

3.3 Term and Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated.

IBM may terminate Licensee's license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement.

If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee's copies of the Program. Any terms of this Agreement that by their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to both parties' respective successors and assignees.

4. Charges

Charges, if any, are based on Authorized Use obtained, which is specified in the invoice. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If Licensee wishes to increase its Authorized Use, Licensee must notify IBM or an authorized IBM reseller in advance and pay any applicable charges.

5. Taxes

If any authority imposes on the Program a duty, tax, levy, or fee, excluding those based on IBM's net income, then Licensee agrees to pay that amount, as specified in an invoice, or supply exemption documentation. Licensee is responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date that Licensee obtains it. If any authority imposes a customs duty, tax, levy, or fee for the import into or the export, transfer, access, or use of the Program outside the country in which the original Licensee was granted the license, then Licensee agrees that it is responsible for, and will pay, any amount imposed.

6. Money-back Guarantee

If Licensee is dissatisfied with the Program for any reason and is the original Licensee, Licensee may terminate the license and obtain a refund of the amount Licensee paid, if any, for the Program, provided that Licensee returns the Program to the party from whom Licensee obtained it within 30 days of the invoice date. If the license is for a fixed term that is subject to renewal, then Licensee may obtain a refund only if the Program is returned within the first 30 days of the initial term. If Licensee downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.

7. Program Transfer

Licensee may transfer the Program and all of Licensee's license rights and obligations to another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee is prohibited from transferring the Program to another party.

8. No Warranties

SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR SUPPORT, IF ANY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT.

SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED BY LAW. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. LICENSEE MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 8 ALSO APPLY TO ANY OF IBM'S PROGRAM DEVELOPERS AND SUPPLIERS.

IBM DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT OF ANY KIND, UNLESS IBM SPECIFIES OTHERWISE. IN SUCH EVENT, ANY SUPPORT PROVIDED BY IBM IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.

9. Licensee Data and Databases

To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee's system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond IBM's obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.

Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out of any third party claims.

10. Limitation of Liability

The limitations and exclusions in this Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.

10.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM's entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual direct damages up to the charges (if the Program is subject to fixed term charges, up to twelve months' charges) Licensee paid for the Program that is the subject of the claim.

This limit also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.

10.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:

a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

11. Compliance Verification

For purposes of this Section 11 (Compliance Verification), "ILAN Program Terms" means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.

The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 11 remain in effect during the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.

11.1 Verification Process

Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee's use of all Programs is in compliance with the ILAN Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of IBM's applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with ILAN Program Terms.

Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee's compliance with ILAN Program Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to ILAN Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee's business, and may be conducted on Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.

11.2 Resolution

IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the ILAN Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification.

12. Third Party Notices

The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code ("Third Party Notices") are included for Licensee's information only. These notices can be found in the Program's NOTICES file(s). Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as "Modifiable Third Party Code," IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee's modifications to such third party code. IBM's service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.

13. General

a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.

b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and IBM.

c. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.

d. Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations, including U.S. embargo and sanctions regulations and prohibitions on export for certain end uses or to certain users.

e. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business Partners) to store and use Licensee's business contact information wherever they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in furtherance of IBM's business relationship with Licensee.

f. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.

g. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation: 1) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the claim lapse.

h. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.

i. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is IBM responsible for any third party claims against Licensee, except as permitted in Subsection 10.1 (Items for Which IBM May Be Liable) above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.

j. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any representation not specified in this Agreement, including but not limited to any representation concerning: 1) the performance or function of the Program; 2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or savings that Licensee may achieve.

k. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called "IBM Business Partners") to promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business Partners remain independent and separate from IBM. IBM is not responsible for the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations they have to Licensee.

l. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee's other agreements with IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to Program licenses granted under this Agreement.

m. Both parties agree that all information exchanged is nonconfidential. If either party requires the exchange of confidential information, it will be made under a signed confidentiality agreement.

AUSTRIA

8. No Warranties

In Austria (and Germany) the following replaces Section 8 (No Warranties) in its entirety, including its title, if Licensee paid a charge to obtain the Program.

8. Warranties and Exclusions

The warranty period is twelve months from the date of delivery. The limitation period for consumers in action for breach of warranty is the statutory period as a minimum.

The warranty for an IBM Program covers the functionality of the Program for its normal use and the Program's conformity to its specifications.

IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified operating environment it will conform to its specifications. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program or that IBM will correct all Program defects. Licensee is responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program.

The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program.

If the Program does not function as warranted during the warranty period and the problem cannot be resolved with information available, Licensee may return the Program to the party from whom Licensee acquired it and receive a refund of the amount Licensee paid. If Licensee down loaded the Program, Licensee may contact the party from whom Licensee acquired it to obtain the refund.

This is IBM's sole obligation to Licensee, except as otherwise required by applicable statutory law.

1. Definice

"Oprávněné užívání" - stanovená úroveň oprávnění Držitele licence provádět nebo spouštět Program. Tuto úroveň lze měřit na základě počtu uživatelů, miliónů servisních jednotek ("jednotky MSU"), jednotek Processor Value Units ("jednotky PVU") nebo na základě jiné úrovně užívání, kterou stanoví IBM.

"IBM" - společnost International Business Machines Corporation nebo některá z jejích dceřiných společností.

"Licenční informace" ("LI") - dokument uvádějící informace a jakékoli dodatečné podmínky specifické pro Program. Dokument Licenční informace k programu je k dispozici na adrese www.ibm.com/software/sla. Licenční informace lze rovněž nalézt v adresáři s Programem - prostřednictvím systémového příkazu - nebo ve formě příručky, kterou obdržíte s Programem.

"Program" - níže uvedené komponenty, včetně originálu a všech úplných nebo dílčích kopií: 1) strojově čitelné instrukce a data, 2) komponenty, soubory a moduly, 3) audiovizuální obsah (jako jsou obrazy, text, nahrávky nebo obrázky) a 4) související licenční materiály (jako jsou licenční klíče a dokumentace).

2. Struktura smlouvy

Tato smlouva zahrnuje Část 1 - Obecná ustanovení, Část 2 - Podmínky specifické pro zemi (jsou-li nějaká) a dokument Licenční informace a představuje úplnou dohodu mezi Držitelem licence a IBM ve vztahu k užívání Programu. Nahrazuje veškerá předchozí ústní nebo písemná ujednání mezi Držitelem licence a IBM ohledně jeho užívání Programu. Podmínky Části 2 mohou nahrazovat nebo upravovat podmínky Části 1. V míře, v níž se vyskytne rozpor podmínek, mají podmínky dokumentu Licenční informace přednost před podmínkami obou Částí.

3. Udělení licence

Program je vlastnictvím IBM nebo dodavatele IBM, je chráněn autorskými právy a je k němu poskytováno právo užívání, není prodáván.

IBM uděluje Držiteli licence nevýhradní licenci na 1) užívání Programu až do úrovně Oprávněného užívání uvedené na faktuře, 2) vytvoření a instalaci kopií na podporu takového Oprávněného užívání, a 3) vytvoření záložní kopie, to vše za předpokladu, že:

a. Držitel licence získal Program zákonným způsobem a dodržuje podmínky této Smlouvy;

b. záložní kopie není spouštěna, ledaže nelze spustit zálohovaný Program;

c. Držitel licence uvádí všechna upozornění o autorských právech a další výhrady vlastnických práv na každé kopii nebo dílčí kopii Programu;

d. Držitel licence zajistí, aby každá osoba (s lokálním nebo vzdáleným přístupem) používající Program 1) tak činila pouze jménem Držitele licence, a 2) tak činila v souladu s podmínkami této Smlouvy;

e. Držitel licence nesmí 1) používat, kopírovat, upravovat nebo distribuovat Program jinak, než je výslovně dovoleno touto Smlouvou; 2) zpětně sestavovat, zpětně kompilovat či jakkoliv překládat Program, není-li to výslovně dovoleno zákonem bez možnosti toto povolení smluvně vyloučit; 3) užívat kterékoli komponenty, soubory, moduly, audiovizuální obsah nebo související licenční materiály nezávisle na Programu; nebo 4) Program sublicencovat, pronajímat či poskytovat formou leasingu; a

f. jestliže Držitel licence získá tento Program jako Podpůrný program, bude jej používat pouze na podporu Základního programu a v souladu s veškerými omezeními uvedenými v licenci na Základní program, nebo - jestliže Držitel licence získá tento program jako Základní program - bude používat všechny Podpůrné programy pouze na podporu tohoto Programu a v souladu s veškerými omezeními stanovenými v této Smlouvě. Pro účely tohoto bodu "f" znamená "Podpůrný program" program, který je součástí jiného programu IBM ("Základní program") a je v Licenčních informacích k Základnímu programu jako Podpůrný program uveden. (Chce-li Držitel licence získat samostatnou licenci na neomezené užívání Podpůrného programu, musí se obrátit na subjekt, od něhož Podpůrný program zakoupil.)

Tato licence se vztahuje na každou kopii Programu, kterou Držitel licence vytvoří.

3.1 Přechody typu Trade-up, aktualizace a opravy

3.1.1 Přechody typu Trade-up

V případě nahrazení Programu programem typu Trade-up platnost licence nahrazeného Programu okamžitě končí.

3.1.2 Aktualizace, opravy a záplaty

Pokud Držitel licence obdrží aktualizaci nebo opravu k Programu, akceptuje veškeré dodatečné nebo odlišné podmínky, které jsou uvedeny v Licenčních informacích pro tuto aktualizaci nebo opravu. Nejsou-li k aktualizaci či opravě dodatečné nebo odlišné podmínky připojeny, pak se taková aktualizace či oprava řídí výlučně podmínkami této Smlouvy. Držitel licence se zavazuje, že v případě nahrazení Programu aktualizací přestane původní Program okamžitě používat.

3.2 Licence na dobu určitou

Licencuje-li IBM Program na dobu určitou, pak licenční oprávnění Držitele licence končí ke konci takové doby určité, ledaže se Držitel licence a IBM dohodli na prodloužení licence.

3.3 Trvání a ukončení Smlouvy

Tato Smlouva je účinná až do jejího ukončení.

IBM je oprávněna ukončit licenci Držitele licence, jestliže tento nedodržuje podmínky této Smlouvy.

Ukončí-li kterákoli ze stran licenci z jakéhokoli důvodu, Držitel licence je povinen okamžitě přestat používat a zničit všechny kopie Programu, které má ve svém držení. Podmínky této Smlouvy, jež svou povahou přesahují dobu její platnosti, zůstávají plně v platnosti a jsou účinné až do okamžiku jejich splnění a platí i pro případné právní nástupce a postupníky smluvních stran.

4. Cena

Poplatky (jsou-li nějaké) jsou založeny na úrovni Oprávněného užívání, která je uvedena na faktuře. IBM nevrací ani jinak nerefunduje již splatné nebo zaplacené částky, s výjimkou případů, které jsou specifikovány jinde v této smlouvě.

Přeje-li si Držitel licence úroveň Oprávněného užívání zvýšit, je povinen o této skutečnosti předem informovat IBM nebo oprávněného prodejce IBM a uhradit veškeré příslušné poplatky.

5. Daně

Bude-li na Program některým úřadem uvaleno clo, daň či poplatek, vyjma těch, které jsou založeny na čistém příjmu IBM, pak se Držitel licence zavazuje tuto částku uhradit ve výši uvedené na faktuře, pokud nepředloží potvrzení prokazující jeho osvobození od takové povinnosti. Od data obdržení Programu je Držitel licence odpovědný za úhradu veškerých případných majetkových daní. Jestliže některý orgán k tomu oprávněný uvalí clo, daň či poplatek na import nebo export, přenos, přístup nebo užívání Programu mimo zemi, v níž byla původnímu Držiteli licence udělena licence, pak je Držitel licence povinen uhradit jakoukoli takto uvalenou částku.

6. Záruka vrácení peněz

Není-li Držitel licence z jakéhokoli důvodu spokojen s Programem a je původním Držitelem licence, je oprávněn ukončit licenci a má nárok na refundaci částky, kterou za Program zaplatil (pokud nějakou částku zaplatil), avšak za předpokladu, že Držitel licence vrátí Program straně, od které jej získal, během 30 dní od data faktury. Jedná-li se o licenci na dobu určitou, která podléhá prodloužení, má Držitel licence nárok na refundaci pouze v případě, že Program vrátí během prvních 30 dní původního období. Pokud Držitel licence Program stáhnul, měl by požádat subjekt, od kterého jej získal, o pokyny, jak dosáhnout vrácení peněz.

7. Převod programu

Držitel licence je oprávněn převést Program a veškerá licenční práva a povinnosti Držitele licence na jinou smluvní stranu za předpokladu, že tato strana akceptuje podmínky této Smlouvy. V případě ukončení licence kteroukoli smluvní stranou bez ohledu na důvod nesmí Držitel licence Program na jinou smluvní stranu převést. Držitel licence není oprávněn převádět část 1) Programu; nebo 2) Oprávněné užívání programu. V případě převodu Programu musí Držitel licence převést rovněž tištěnou verzi této Smlouvy, včetně dokumentu Licenční informace. Licenční oprávnění Držitele licence okamžitě po převodu končí.

8. Vyloučení záruky

V SOULADU S VEŠKERÝMI ZÁKONNÝMI ZÁRUKAMI, KTERÉ NELZE VYLOUČIT, NEPOSKYTUJE IBM ŽÁDNÉ ZÁRUKY ČI PODMÍNKY, VYJÁDŘENÉ VÝSLOVNĚ NEBO VYPLÝVAJÍCÍ Z OKOLNOSTÍ, POKUD JDE O PROGRAM NEBO PODPORU (JE-LI NĚJAKÁ POSKYTOVÁNA), VČETNĚ - A TO ZEJMÉNA - VEŠKERÝCH ZÁRUK ČI PODMÍNEK PRODEJNOSTI, USPOKOJIVÉ KVALITY, VHODNOSTI PRO URČITÝ ÚČEL A VLASTNICKÉHO NÁROKU, A JAKÉKOLI ZÁRUKY ČI PODMÍNKY NEPORUŠENÍ PRÁV TŘETÍCH STRAN.

NĚKTERÉ STÁTY NEBO JURISDIKCE NEPŘIPOUŠTĚJÍ VYLOUČENÍ ZÁRUK VYJÁDŘENÝCH VÝSLOVNĚ NEBO VYPLÝVAJÍCÍCH Z OKOLNOSTÍ, A PROTO SE VÝŠE UVEDENÉ ZÁRUKY NEMUSÍ NA DRŽITELE LICENCE VZTAHOVAT. V TAKOVÉM PŘÍPADĚ JSOU TAKOVÉ ZÁRUKY ČASOVĚ OMEZENY POUZE NA MINIMÁLNÍ DOBU POŽADOVANOU ZÁKONEM. PO UKONČENÍ TÉTO DOBY IBM NEPOSKYTUJE ŽÁDNÉ DALŠÍ ZÁRUKY. NĚKTERÉ STÁTY NEBO JURISDIKCE NEPŘIPOUŠTĚJÍ OMEZENÍ DOBY TRVÁNÍ IMPLICITNÍ ZÁRUKY, A PROTO SE VÝŠE UVEDENÉ OMEZENÍ NA DRŽITELE LICENCE NEMUSÍ VZTAHOVAT. DRŽITEL LICENCE MŮŽE MÍT I DALŠÍ PRÁVA, KTERÁ SE LIŠÍ STÁT OD STÁTU NEBO JURISDIKCE OD JURISDIKCE.

VYLOUČENÍ ZÁRUKY UVEDENÁ V TOMTO ODDÍLU 8 SE VZTAHUJÍ ROVNĚŽ NA VEŠKERÉ VÝVOJÁŘE A DODAVATELE IBM.

VÝROBCI, DODAVATELÉ NEBO DISTRIBUTOŘI PROGRAMŮ OD JINÝCH DODAVATELŮ MOHOU POSKYTOVAT SVÉ VLASTNÍ ZÁRUKY.

NESTANOVÍ-LI IBM VÝSLOVNĚ JINAK, PAK IBM NEPOSKYTUJE PODPORU ŽÁDNÉHO DRUHU. V TAKOVÉM PŘÍPADĚ SE NA JAKOUKOLI PODPORU POSKYTOVANOU SPOLEČNOSTÍ IBM VZTAHUJÍ VYLOUČENÍ ZÁRUKY UVEDENÁ V TOMTO ODDÍLU 8.

9. Data a databáze Držitele licence

IBM může s cílem pomoci Držiteli licence s určením problému s Programem požadovat, aby Držitel licence 1) umožnil IBM vzdálený přístup k systému Držitele licence, nebo 2) aby zaslal IBM příslušné údaje nebo systémová data. IBM však není povinna poskytnout takovou asistenci, pokud IBM a Držitel licence neuzavřeli samostatnou písemnou dohodu, na jejímž základě se IBM zavazuje, že bude Držiteli licence poskytovat tento typ podpory, který přesahuje povinnosti IBM vyplývající z této Smlouvy. IBM za všech okolností používá informace o chybách a problémech ke zdokonalování jejích produktů a služeb a poskytuje klientům asistenci prostřednictvím souvisejících nabídek podpory. K tomuto účelu může IBM využít služeb subjektů a dodavatelů IBM (včetně subjektů a dodavatelů z jedné nebo více jiných zemí, než je země, v níž má sídlo Držitel licence) a Držitel licence opravňuje IBM k takovému využití služeb subjektů a dodavatelů IBM.

Držitel licence zůstává odpovědný za 1) veškerá data a obsah jakékoli databáze, kterou pro IBM zpřístupní, 2) výběr a implementaci postupů a kontrol týkajících se přístupu, zabezpečení, šifrování, užívání a přenosu dat (včetně veškerých osobních údajů), a 3) zálohování a obnovu jakékoli databáze a veškerých uložených dat. Držitel licence nesmí odeslat IBM žádné osobní údaje nebo poskytnout IBM přístup k žádným osobním údajům, ať už ve formě dat nebo v nějaké jiné formě, a nese odpovědnost za veškeré přiměřené náklady nebo jiné výdaje, které mohou IBM vzniknout v souvislosti s neoprávněným poskytnutím takových informací IBM nebo v souvislosti se ztrátou či zpřístupněním informací ze strany IBM, včetně těch založených na nárocích třetích stran.

10. Omezení odpovědnosti

Omezení odpovědnosti a vyloučení záruky v tomto oddíle 10 (Omezení odpovědnosti) se aplikuje v plném rozsahu, pokud není zakázáno ze zákona, bez možnosti smluvního zřeknutí se.

10.1 Položky, za které IBM nese odpovědnost

Mohou nastat okolnosti, kdy má Držitel licence z důvodu neplnění závazku na straně IBM nebo jiné odpovědnosti nárok na náhradu škody od IBM. Bez ohledu na příčinu vzniku nároku Držitele licence na náhradu škody od IBM (včetně podstatného porušení, nedbalosti, přivedení v omyl nebo jiného porušení závazkového či mimozávazkového vztahu), odpovídá IBM pouze za nároky vzniklé na základě každého Programu nebo ve spojení s ním nebo za nároky jinak vzniklé na základě této Smlouvy, a tato odpovědnost nesmí přesáhnout částku jakýchkoli 1) škod na zdraví (včetně smrti) a škod na nemovitém a osobním hmotném majetku, a 2) jiných skutečných přímých škod, až do výše poplatků, které Držitel licence zaplatil za Program, který je předmětem nároku (pokud je Program licencován na dobu určitou, pak do výše dvanácti měsíčních poplatků).

Toto omezení se vztahuje rovněž i na všechny vývojáře a dodavatele Programů IBM. Jedná se o maximum, za které IBM a její vývojáři a dodavatelé Programů společně odpovídají.

10.2 Položky, za které IBM nenese odpovědnost

VYJMA PŘÍPADŮ, KDY JE TO VÝSLOVNĚ POŽADOVÁNO PRÁVNÍMI PŘEDPISY BEZ MOŽNOSTI VZDÁNÍ SE PRÁVA SMLUVNĚ, NEBUDOU IBM, JEJÍ SUBDODAVATELÉ ANI VÝVOJÁŘI PROGRAMŮ ZA ŽÁDNÝCH OKOLNOSTÍ ODPOVĚDNI ZA NÁSLEDUJÍCÍ, A TO V PŘÍPADĚ, ŽE BY IBM BYLA NA TAKOVOU MOŽNOST UPOZORNĚNA:

11. Kontrola dodržování podmínek

Pro účely tohoto oddílu 11 (Kontrola dodržování podmínek), znamenají "Podmínky ILAN" 1) tuto Smlouvu a příslušné dodatky a transakční dokumenty poskytnuté IBM, a 2) softwarové postupy IBM, které jsou k dispozici na webových stránkách IBM Software Policy (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies) včetně - a to zejména - postupů týkajících se zálohování, cen pro neúplný server a migrace.

Práva a povinnosti uvedená dále v tomto oddílu 11 zůstávají v platnosti po dobu trvání licence a dva roky poté.

11.1 Proces ověřování

Držitel licence souhlasí, že vytvoří, bude uchovávat a poskytne IBM a jejím auditorům přesné písemné záznamy, výstupy systémových nástrojů a další systémové informace, které budou dostatečné k ověření, že Držitel licence užívá všechny Programy v souladu s podmínkami smlouvy ILAN, včetně všech příslušných podmínek IBM týkajících se licencování a cen. Držitel licence nese odpovědnost za 1) zajištění, že nepřekročí svou úroveň Oprávněného užívání, a 2) bude jednat v souladu s podmínkami smlouvy ILAN.

IBM je na základě oznámení zaslaného v přiměřené dlouhé lhůtě předem oprávněna ověřit si, zda Držitel licence dodržuje podmínky smlouvy ILAN na všech pracovištích a pro všechna prostředí, v nichž používá Programy (k jakémukoli účelu) v souladu s podmínkami smlouvy ILAN. Takové ověření bude provedeno způsobem, jenž bude minimalizovat rušení obchodní činnosti Držitele licence a smí být provedeno v prostorách Držitele licence během řádné pracovní doby. IBM je oprávněna využít k takové kontrole služeb nezávislého auditora, a to za předpokladu, že IBM s tímto auditorem uzavře písemnou smlouvu o ochraně důvěrných informací.

11.2 Rozhodnutí

IBM bude Držitele písemně informovat, jestliže bude v rámci kontroly dodržování podmínek zjištěno, že Držitel licence užívá Program v rozsahu přesahujícím úroveň jeho Oprávněného užívání nebo jiným způsobem nedodržuje podmínky smlouvy ILAN. Držitel licence se zavazuje, že neprodleně uhradí přímo IBM poplatky, které IBM uvede na faktuře za 1) jakékoli takové nadměrné užívání, 2) podporu pro takové nadměrné užívání za dobu trvání takového nadměrného užívání nebo za dva roky (podle toho, které období je kratší), a 3) jakékoli dodatečné poplatky nebo jiné částky, které budou stanoveny na základě výsledků takové kontroly.

12. Poznámky třetích stran

Program může zahrnovat kód třetích stran, ke kterému Držiteli licence poskytuje licenci na základě této Smlouvy IBM, nikoli třetí strana. Jsou-li uvedeny jakékoli poznámky vztahující se ke kódu třetích stran ("Poznámky třetích stran"), jsou uvedeny pouze pro informaci Držitele licence. Tyto poznámky mohou být uvedeny v souboru(ech) NOTICES k Programu. Informace o způsobu získání zdrojového kódu pro určitý kód třetích stran najdete v Poznámkách třetích stran. Jestliže IBM v Poznámkách třetích stran označí kód třetích stran za "Kód třetích stran s možností modifikace", pak IBM opravňuje Držitele licence k 1) modifikaci Kódu třetích stran s možností modifikace a 2) ke zpětné kompilaci Programových modulů, které mají přímé rozhraní ke Kódu třetích stran s možností modifikace, za předpokladu, že tyto činnosti budou sloužit výhradně k ladění modifikací prováděných Držitelem licence u takového Kódu třetích stran. Závazek IBM týkající se servisu a podpory (je-li nějaký) se vztahuje pouze na nemodifikovaný Program.

13. Všeobecná ustanovení

a. Touto Smlouvou nejsou dotčena zákonná práva spotřebitelů, jichž se není možno smluvně zříci nebo jež nemohou být smluvně omezena.

b. Není-li mezi Držitelem licence a IBM písemně dohodnuto jinak, splní IBM u Programů, které dodává Držiteli licence v hmotné podobě, svůj závazek odeslat a dodat předmětné Programy jejich předáním přepravci určenému IBM.

c. V případě, že by některé ustanovení této Smlouvy bylo považováno za neplatné nebo nevymahatelné, zůstanou zbývající ustanovení této Smlouvy v plné platnosti a účinnosti.

d. Každá ze smluvních stran bude postupovat v souladu s příslušnými vývozními a dovozními právními předpisy, včetně právních předpisů Spojených států amerických, které zakazují či omezují vývoz pro účely určitého použití či pro určité koncové uživatele. Držitel licence se zavazuje, že bude postupovat v souladu s příslušnými vývozními a dovozními právními předpisy, včetně právních předpisů Spojených států amerických, které zakazují či omezují vývoz pro účely určitého použití či pro určité koncové uživatele.

e. Držitel licence souhlasí s tím, že umožní společnosti International Business Machines Corporation a jejím dceřiným společnostem (včetně jejich právních nástupců, postupníků, subdodavatelů a obchodních partnerů) ukládat a užívat jeho kontaktní informace všude, kde tito uskutečňují svou obchodní činnost související s produkty a službami IBM, nebo v rámci podpory obchodního vztahu mezi IBM a držitelem Licence.

f. Každá ze smluvních stran poskytne druhé straně přiměřeně možnost nápravy předtím, než vůči druhé straně vznese nároky související s neplněním jejích povinností z této Smlouvy. Smluvní strany se pokusí v dobré vůli vyřešit jakékoli spory, neshody či nároky vztahující se k této Smlouvě.

g. Nevyžadují-li příslušné právní předpisy jinak, bez možnosti smluvního zřeknutí se nebo omezení: 1) žádná ze smluvních stran nezahájí právní úkon (bez ohledu na jeho formu) ohledně jakéhokoli nároku vzniklého na základě této Smlouvy nebo ve spojení s touto Smlouvou později než dva roky od data vzniku příčiny takového právního úkonu; a 2) veškeré takové nároky a všechna příslušná práva vztahující se k takovým nárokům se po vypršení takového časového limitu považují za promlčené.

h. Žádná ze smluvních stran nenese odpovědnost za nesplnění jakýchkoli závazků, pokud k takovému neplnění došlo z důvodů vzniklých nezávisle na její vůli.

i. Tato Smlouva nezakládá pro žádnou třetí stranu žádné právo nebo důvod k žalobě a IBM nenese odpovědnost za žádné nároky třetích stran vznesené vůči Držiteli licence, s výjimkou, jak uvádí odstavec 10.1 (Položky, za které IBM nenese odpovědnost) výše, škody na zdraví (včetně smrti) nebo škody na nemovitém nebo hmotném osobním majetku, za které je IBM vůči takové třetí straně právně odpovědná.

j. Smluvní strany se dohodly, že se po uzavření toto Smlouvy nebudou odvolávat na žádné prohlášení, které není v této Smlouvě uvedeno, včetně jakéhokoli prohlášení, které se týká: 1) výkonu či fungování Programu; 2) zkušeností nebo doporučení jiných stran; nebo 3) jakýchkoli výsledků či úspor, kterých může Držitel licence dosáhnout.

k. IBM uzavřela smlouvy s určitými organizacemi (dále jen "Obchodní partneři IBM") za účelem nabízení, zprostředkování prodeje a podpory vybraných Programů. Obchodní partneři IBM zůstávají organizacemi nezávislými na IBM. IBM nenese odpovědnost za jednání nebo prohlášení Obchodních partnerů IBM, ani za jejich závazky vůči Držiteli licence.

l. Licenční podmínky a podmínky týkající se odškodnění ve vztahu k právu duševního vlastnictví uvedené v jiných smlouvách, jež Držitel licence uzavřel s IBM (jako je například smlouva IBM Customer Agreement), se nevztahují na licence na Program udělené na základě této Smlouvy.

m. Obě smluvní strany berou na vědomí, že veškeré vzájemně sdělené informace nejsou důvěrné. Vyžaduje-li některá ze smluvních stran výměnu důvěrných informací, pak taková výměna musí proběhnout na základě smlouvy o utajení důvěrných informací;

14. Geografický rozsah a rozhodné právo

14.1 Rozhodné právo

Smluvní strany souhlasí s použitím práva země, v níž Držitel licence zakoupil licenci na Program, podle kterého se budou řídit, vykládat a uplatňovat veškeré práva, povinnosti a závazky Držitele licence a IBM z této Smlouvy či vztahující se k jejímu předmětu a to bez ohledu na rozpor právních zásad.

Úmluva OSN o smlouvách o mezinárodní koupi zboží se neaplikuje.

14.2 Jurisdikce

Všechna práva, povinnosti a závazky budou podléhat rozhodnutím příslušných soudů země, v níž Držitel licence obdržel licenci na Program.

2. Struktur dieser Vereinbarung

Diese Vereinbarung besteht aus Teil 1 - Allgemeine Bedingungen, Teil 2 - Länderspezifische Bedingungen (sofern vorhanden) und den Lizenzinformationen und stellt die vollständige Vereinbarung zwischen dem Lizenznehmer und IBM zur Nutzung des Programms dar. Sie ersetzt alle zuvor getroffenen mündlichen oder schriftlichen Absprachen zwischen dem Lizenznehmer und IBM in Bezug auf die Nutzung des Programms durch den Lizenznehmer.

In diesem Abschnitt bezeichnet ein "Unterstützungsprogramm" ein Programm, das Teil eines anderen IBM Programms ("Hauptprogramm") ist und in der Lizenzinformation des Hauptprogramms als Unterstützungsprogramm aufgeführt wird. (Um eine separate Lizenz für das Unterstützungsprogramm ohne diese Einschränkungen zu erwerben, sollte sich der Lizenznehmer an die Stelle wenden, von der er das Unterstützungsprogramm bezogen hat.)

Diese Lizenz gilt für jede Kopie des Programms, die der Lizenznehmer erstellt.

3.1 Trade-ups, Updates, Fixes und Patches

3.1.1 Trade-ups

Wird das Programm durch ein Trade-up-Programm ersetzt, dann erlischt die Lizenz des ersetzten Programms unverzüglich.

3.1.2 Updates, Fixes und Patches

Wenn der Lizenznehmer Updates, Fixes oder Patches für ein Programm erhält, dann akzeptiert er alle zusätzlichen oder abweichenden Bedingungen, die in der Lizenzinformation für die Updates, Fixes oder Patches aufgeführt sind. Werden keine zusätzlichen oder abweichenden Bedingungen bereitgestellt, unterliegen die Updates, Fixes oder Patches ausschließlich dieser Vereinbarung. Wird das Programm durch ein Update ersetzt, erklärt sich der Lizenznehmer damit einverstanden, die Nutzung des ersetzten Programms unverzüglich einzustellen.

3.2 Lizenzen mit fester Laufzeit

Wenn IBM das Programm für eine feste Laufzeit lizenziert, dann erlischt die Lizenz des Lizenznehmers mit dem Ablauf der festen Laufzeit, sofern der Lizenznehmer und IBM die Lizenz nicht in beidseitigem Einverständnis verlängern.

3.3 Laufzeit und Kündigung

Diese Vereinbarung bleibt bis zur Kündigung wirksam.

IBM kann die Lizenz des Lizenznehmers kündigen, wenn der Lizenznehmer die Bedingungen dieser Vereinbarung nicht erfüllt.

Wird die Lizenz von einer der Vertragsparteien aus irgendeinem Grund gekündigt, erklärt sich der Lizenznehmer damit einverstanden, die Nutzung des Programms unverzüglich einzustellen und alle Programmkopien zu vernichten. Bedingungen, die sich ihrer Natur nach auf die Zeit nach einer Beendigung dieser Vereinbarung erstrecken, bleiben bis zu ihrer Erfüllung in Kraft und gelten auch für eventuelle Rechtsnachfolger und Zessionare.

4. Gebühren

Die Gebühren (sofern Gebühren anfallen) basieren auf der erworbenen berechtigten Nutzung, die auf der Rechnung angegeben ist. IBM gewährt keine Gutschriften oder Rückerstattungen für bereits fällige oder gezahlte Gebühren, mit Ausnahme anderslautender Bestimmungen in dieser Vereinbarung.

Wenn der Lizenznehmer die berechtigte Nutzung erhöhen will, wird er IBM oder einen autorisierten IBM Reseller vorab benachrichtigen und die anfallenden Gebühren bezahlen.

5. Steuern

Der Lizenznehmer trägt die mit dem Programm verbundenen und von IBM angegebenen Steuern, Abgaben und Gebühren (mit Ausnahme solcher auf den Ertrag von IBM) oder weist eine entsprechende Befreiung nach. Ab dem Datum, an dem der Lizenznehmer das Programm erhält, ist er für alle das Programm betreffenden Vermögenssteuern verantwortlich. Wenn durch den Import oder den Export des Programms, die Übertragung, den Zugriff auf das Programm oder die Nutzung des Programms außerhalb des Landes, in dem der ursprüngliche Lizenznehmer die Lizenz erhalten hat, Zölle, Steuern, Abgaben oder Gebühren auf das Programm erhoben werden, trägt der Lizenznehmer alle entsprechenden Steuern, Abgaben oder Gebühren und wird den in Rechnung gestellten Betrag bezahlen.

6. Geld-zurück-Garantie

Falls der Lizenznehmer aus irgendeinem Grund mit dem Programm nicht zufrieden ist und wenn er der ursprüngliche Lizenznehmer des Programms ist, kann er die Lizenz kündigen und sich den für das Programm gezahlten Betrag zurückerstatten lassen, sofern er das Programm innerhalb von 30 Tagen nach dem Rechnungsdatum an die Stelle zurückgibt, von der er das Programm bezogen hat. Wenn es sich um eine Lizenz mit fester Laufzeit handelt, die verlängert werden kann, kann der Lizenznehmer nur dann eine Rückerstattung anfordern, wenn er das Programm in den ersten 30 Tagen der Erstlaufzeit zurückgibt. Wenn der Lizenznehmer das Programm heruntergeladen hat, erhält er von der Stelle, von der er das Programm bezogen hat, weitere Anweisungen zur Erstattung des gezahlten Betrags.

7. Programmübertragung

Der Lizenznehmer darf das Programm und alle Lizenzrechte und -pflichten nur an Dritte übertragen, wenn diese sich mit den Bedingungen dieser Vereinbarung einverstanden erklären. Wird die Lizenz von einer der Vertragsparteien aus irgendeinem Grund gekündigt, ist es dem Lizenznehmer untersagt, das Programm an Dritte weiterzugeben. Es ist dem Lizenznehmer nicht gestattet, einen Teil 1) des Programms oder 2) der berechtigten Nutzung des Programms zu übertragen. Wird das Programm übertragen, muss der Lizenznehmer auch eine Hardcopy dieser Vereinbarung einschließlich der Lizenzinformation beifügen. Die Lizenz des Lizenznehmers erlischt mit der Übertragung.

8. Gewährleistungsausschluss

Vorbehaltlich einer gesetzlichen Gewährleistung, die nicht ausgeschlossen werden kann, übernimmt IBM keine Gewährleistung (ausdrücklich oder stillschweigend) hinsichtlich des Programms oder der Unterstützung (sofern vorgesehen), einschließlich, aber nicht begrenzt auf die zufriedenstellende Qualität, Handelsüblichkeit, Verwendungsfähigkeit für einen bestimmten Zweck, Eigentumsrecht und die Freiheit von Rechten Dritter.

Nach der Rechtsordnung bzw. Gerichtsbarkeit einiger Länder ist der Ausschluss oder die Begrenzung von ausdrücklichen und/oder stillschweigenden Zusicherungen/Gewährleistungen nicht erlaubt, sodass obige Einschränkungen und Ausschlüsse für den Lizenznehmer möglicherweise nicht anwendbar sind. In diesem Fall sind derartige Gewährleistungen auf die gesetzliche Mindestgewährleistungsdauer begrenzt. Nach Ablauf des Gewährleistungszeitraums wird keinerlei Gewährleistung mehr erbracht. Nach der Rechtsordnung bzw. Gerichtsbarkeit einiger Länder ist der Ausschluss oder die Begrenzung von ausdrücklichen und/oder stillschweigenden Zusicherungen/Gewährleistungen nicht erlaubt, sodass obige Einschränkungen und Ausschlüsse für den Lizenznehmer möglicherweise nicht anwendbar sind. Der Lizenznehmer kann gegebenenfalls weitere Rechte geltend machen, die abhängig vom jeweiligen Land und der jeweiligen Rechtsordnung bzw. Gerichtsbarkeit unterschiedlich sein können.

Die Gewährleistungsausschlüsse und sonstigen Ausschlüsse in diesem Abschnitt 8 gelten auch für die Programmentwickler und Lieferanten von IBM.

Für Nicht-IBM Programme können die Hersteller, Lieferanten und Herausgeber ihre eigenen Gewährleistungen mitliefern.

IBM leistet nur Unterstützung, wenn dies ausdrücklich angegeben ist. Falls IBM Unterstützung leistet, unterliegt diese den Gewährleistungsausschlüssen und sonstigen Ausschlüssen in diesem Abschnitt 8.

9. Daten und Datenbanken des Lizenznehmers

Um den Lizenznehmer bei der Eingrenzung eines Problems mit dem Programm zu unterstützen, kann IBM den Lizenznehmer auffordern, 1) IBM Fernzugriff auf sein System zu gestatten oder 2) Informationen oder Systemdaten an IBM zu senden. IBM ist jedoch nicht zur Erbringung solcher Unterstützungsleistungen verpflichtet, es sei denn, IBM und der Lizenznehmer treffen eine separate schriftliche Vereinbarung, in der IBM sich bereit erklärt, Unterstützung für den Lizenznehmer in einem Umfang zu leisten, der die Verpflichtungen von IBM unter dieser Vereinbarung überschreitet. In jedem Fall wird IBM die Informationen über Fehler und Probleme zur Verbesserung der IBM Produkte und Services nutzen und Unterstützung durch die Bereitstellung entsprechender Unterstützungsangebote leisten. Zu diesem Zweck kann IBM andere IBM Organisationen und Subunternehmer (auch in Ländern außerhalb des Landes, in welchem der Lizenznehmer seinen Sitz hat) beauftragen, und der Lizenznehmer wird IBM dies gestatten.

Der Lizenznehmer bleibt verantwortlich für 1) alle Daten und den Inhalt der Datenbanken, die er IBM zur Verfügung stellt, 2) die Auswahl und Implementierung von Prozeduren und Kontrollmechanismen im Hinblick auf Datenzugriff, -sicherheit, -verschlüsselung, -nutzung und -übertragung (einschließlich aller personenbezogenen Daten) und 3) die Sicherung und Wiederherstellung der Datenbanken und der gespeicherten Daten. Der Lizenznehmer wird IBM keine personenbezogenen Informationen, weder als Daten noch in anderer Form, senden oder Zugriff darauf erteilen und muss für alle angemessenen Kosten und sonstigen Ausgaben aufkommen, die IBM im Zusammenhang mit solchen Informationen entstehen, die versehentlich an IBM weitergegeben wurden oder deren Verlust oder Offenlegung durch IBM verursacht wurde, einschließlich der Aufwendungen, die sich aus den Ansprüchen Dritter ergeben.

10. Haftungsbegrenzung

Die Beschränkungen und Ausschlüsse in Abschnitt 10 gelten, soweit nicht durch gesetzliche Regelung etwas anderes zwingend vorgesehen ist.

10.1 Fälle, in denen IBM haftbar gemacht werden kann

Soweit IBM dem Lizenznehmer gegenüber schadenersatzpflichtig ist, hat er Anspruch auf Entschädigung durch IBM. Unabhängig vom Rechtsgrund, auf dem der an IBM gerichtete Schadensersatzanspruch des Lizenznehmers beruht (einschließlich Vertragsverletzung, Fahrlässigkeit, unrichtiger Angaben oder anderer Ansprüche aus dem Vertrag oder aufgrund unerlaubter Handlungen), ist die Gesamthaftung von IBM für sämtliche Ansprüche in Bezug auf ein einzelnes Programm oder andere Ansprüche, die aus dieser Vereinbarung entstehen, begrenzt auf 1) Personenschäden (einschließlich Tod) und Schäden an Immobilien und beweglichen Sachen und 2) bei anderen direkten Schäden auf maximal die Gebühren (maximal zwölf Monatsgebühren, wenn die Gebühren für das Programm nach einer festen Laufzeit berechnet werden), die der Lizenznehmer für das Programm entrichtet hat, das die Grundlage des Rechtsanspruches ist.

Diese Haftungsbegrenzung gilt auch für alle Programmentwickler und Lieferanten von IBM. Dies ist der maximale Betrag, für den IBM und diese gemeinsam haftbar gemacht werden können.

10.2 Fälle, in denen IBM nicht haftbar ist

Auf keinen Fall sind IBM oder die Programmentwickler und Lieferanten von IBM in folgenden Fällen haftbar, auch wenn sie auf die Möglichkeit solcher Schäden hingewiesen wurden:

a. Verlust oder Beschädigung von Daten;

b. unmittelbare oder mittelbare Schäden oder sonstige wirtschaftliche Folgeschäden; oder

c. entgangene Gewinne, Geschäftsabschlüsse, Umsätze, Schädigung des guten Namens oder Verlust erwarteter Einsparungen.

11. Einsichts- und Prüfungsrecht

In diesem Abschnitt 11 bezeichnet "Nutzungsbedingungen" 1) diese Vereinbarung sowie alle anwendbaren Anlagen und Auftragsdokumente, die von IBM bereitgestellt werden, und 2) IBM Softwarerichtlinien, die auf der IBM Software Policy Website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies) zu finden sind, einschließlich der Richtlinien, die sich auf Sicherungen, das Sub-Capacity-Preismodell und die Migration beziehen.

Die Rechte und Verpflichtungen im Rahmen dieses Abschnitts 11 bleiben während der Lizenzlaufzeit und danach für weitere zwei Jahre in Kraft.

11.1 Prüfungsprozess

Der Lizenznehmer verpflichtet sich, korrekte schriftliche Aufzeichnungen, Ausgaben von Systemtools und sonstige Systemdaten zu erstellen, aufzubewahren und IBM sowie den beauftragten Prüfern bereitzustellen, um gegenüber IBM prüffähige Nachweise dafür zu erbringen, dass die Nutzung der Programme in Übereinstimmung mit den Nutzungsbedingungen erfolgt, einschließlich der angewandten IBM Lizenz- und Preisbedingungen. Der Lizenznehmer ist dafür verantwortlich, 1) sicherzustellen, dass die berechtigte Nutzung nicht überschritten wird und 2) die Nutzungsbedingungen eingehalten werden.

Nach angemessener Vorankündigung ist IBM dazu berechtigt, die Einhaltung der Nutzungsbedingungen an allen Standorten des Lizenznehmers und für alle Umgebungen, an denen der Lizenznehmer die den Nutzungsbedingungen unterliegenden Programme (zu irgendeinem Zweck) nutzt, zu überprüfen. Die Prüfung findet während der üblichen Geschäftszeiten in den Räumlichkeiten des Lizenznehmers statt. IBM wird sich bemühen, den Geschäftsbetrieb des Lizenznehmers dabei so wenig wie möglich zu beeinträchtigen. IBM ist berechtigt, die Prüfung durch einen unabhängigen Prüfer durchführen zu lassen, soweit dieser durch eine schriftliche Vertraulichkeitsvereinbarung zur Geheimhaltung verpflichtet ist.

11.2 Prüfergebnis

IBM wird den Lizenznehmer schriftlich benachrichtigen, sofern eine solche Überprüfung ergibt, dass der Lizenznehmer die berechtigte Nutzung eines Programms überschritten hat oder der Lizenznehmer die ihm aus dieser Vereinbarung obliegenden Verpflichtungen nicht einhält. Der Lizenznehmer erklärt sich dazu bereit, die in einer Rechnung von IBM aufgeführten Gebühren für 1) die Nutzungsüberschreitung, 2) die Unterstützung während der Nutzungsüberschreitung entweder für die Dauer der Nutzungsüberschreitung oder für zwei Jahre, je nachdem, welcher Zeitraum kürzer ist, und 3) alle anfallenden zusätzlichen Gebühren und anderen Verbindlichkeiten, die sich aufgrund der Prüfung ergeben, unverzüglich direkt an IBM zu entrichten.

12. Hinweise von Drittherstellern

Das Programm kann Drittherstellercode enthalten, für den IBM und nicht der Dritthersteller dem Lizenznehmer eine Lizenz unter dieser Vereinbarung erteilt. Falls Hinweise auf den Drittherstellercode ("Third Party Notices") mitgeliefert werden, geschieht dies nur zu Informationszwecken. Diese Hinweise können in den NOTICES-Dateien des Programms enthalten sein. Informationen über den Erhalt des Quellcodes für einen bestimmten Drittherstellercode befinden sich in den Third Party Notices. Kennzeichnet IBM Drittherstellercode in den Third Party Notices als "Modifiable Third Party Code" (Drittherstellercode, der geändert werden kann), so erteilt IBM dem Lizenznehmer damit die Berechtigung, 1) den Modifiable Third Party Code zu verändern und 2) die Programmmodule rückzuentwickeln, die eine direkte Schnittstelle zu dem Modifiable Third Party Code darstellen, sofern dies ausschließlich zu dem Zweck erfolgt, die Änderungen des Lizenznehmers am Drittherstellercode per Debugging zu testen. Die Service- und Unterstützungsverpflichtungen von IBM (sofern verfügbar) beziehen sich nur auf das unveränderte Programm.

13. Allgemeines

a. Gesetzlich unabdingbare Verbraucherschutzrechte haben Vorrang vor den Bedingungen dieser Vereinbarung.

b. Werden die Programme auf Datenträgern an den Lizenznehmer geliefert, geht - sofern nicht zwischen den Parteien etwas Abweichendes schriftlich vereinbart wurde - die Gefahr auf den Lizenznehmer über, sobald IBM den Datenträger an den von IBM bestimmten Spediteur/Frachtführer oder die sonst zur Ausführung der Auslieferung bestimmte Person oder Anstalt ausgeliefert hat.

c. Falls eine der Bedingungen dieser Vereinbarung im Rahmen des geltenden Rechts ungültig oder undurchführbar ist, sind die übrigen Bedingungen dieser Vereinbarung davon nicht betroffen und gelten weiterhin in vollem Umfang.

d. Der Lizenznehmer verpflichtet sich zur Einhaltung aller anwendbaren Export- und Importgesetze und -bestimmungen, einschließlich der US-Embargo- und -Sanktionsbestimmungen sowie des Exportverbots für bestimmte Verwendungszwecke oder an bestimmte Personen.

e. Der Lizenznehmer ist damit einverstanden, dass International Business Machines Corporation und deren verbundene Unternehmen (sowie deren Rechtsnachfolger und Zessionare, Vertragspartner und IBM Business Partner) die Kontaktinformationen des Lizenznehmers in allen Ländern, in denen sie geschäftlich tätig sind, in Verbindung mit IBM Produkten und Services oder zur Förderung der Geschäftsbeziehung zwischen IBM und dem Lizenznehmer speichern und nutzen dürfen.

f. Jede Vertragspartei wird der anderen Partei ausreichend Gelegenheit geben, ihren vertraglichen Verpflichtungen nachzukommen, bevor sie rechtliche Schritte wegen Nichterfüllung von Vertragsbedingungen unternimmt. Die Vertragsparteien werden versuchen, alle Streitfälle, Meinungsverschiedenheiten oder Ansprüche zwischen den Parteien in Bezug auf diese Vereinbarung einvernehmlich beizulegen.

g. Soweit nicht durch gesetzliche Regelung etwas anderes zwingend vorgesehen ist, stimmen beide Vertragsparteien überein, 1) im Rahmen dieser Vereinbarung keine Klage später als zwei Jahre nach Auftreten des Klagegegenstands einzureichen, und 2) dass nach Ablauf dieser Frist alle Ansprüche und alle damit in Zusammenhang stehenden Rechte verjähren.

h. Weder der Lizenznehmer noch IBM sind für die Nichterfüllung von vertraglichen Verpflichtungen aus Gründen haftbar, die von den Vertragsparteien nicht beeinflusst werden können.

i. Aus dieser Vereinbarung ergibt sich kein Recht auf Klage oder Klagegegenstand für Dritte, und IBM ist nicht haftbar für Ansprüche Dritter gegen den Lizenznehmer, die nicht oben in Unterabschnitt 10.1 (Fälle, in denen IBM haftbar gemacht werden kann) für Personenschäden (einschließlich Tod) und Schäden an Immobilien und beweglichen Sachen aufgeführt sind, für die IBM nach den gesetzlichen Bestimmungen haftbar ist.

j. Durch Anerkennung dieser Vereinbarung stimmen beide Vertragsparteien darin überein, sich nicht auf irgendwelche Darstellungen zu verlassen, die nicht auf dieser Vereinbarung beruhen, einschließlich 1) der Angaben zu Leistung oder Funktion des Programms; und 2) der Erfahrungen oder Empfehlungen Dritter; oder 3) der Ergebnisse oder Einsparungen, die der Lizenznehmer eventuell erzielen kann.

k. IBM hat mit bestimmten Partnern ("IBM Business Partner" genannt) Vereinbarungen zur Vermarktung und Unterstützung bestimmter Programme geschlossen. IBM Business Partner sind eigenständig und von IBM unabhängig. IBM ist weder für die Geschäftstätigung der IBM Business Partner noch für deren Aussagen oder Verpflichtungen gegenüber dem Lizenznehmer verantwortlich.

l. Die Lizenzbedingungen und Freistellungsregelungen in anderen (Rahmen-)Vereinbarungen zwischen dem Lizenznehmer und IBM (z. B. den Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen von IBM) gelten nicht für Programmlizenzen, die unter dieser Vereinbarung erteilt werden.

m. Beide Vertragsparteien stimmen darin überein, dass alle ausgetauschten Informationen nicht vertraulich sind. Falls eine der Vertragsparteien den Austausch vertraulicher Informationen als erforderlich ansieht, geschieht dies im Rahmen einer unterzeichneten Vertraulichkeitsvereinbarung.

14. Geltungsbereich und geltendes Recht

14.1 Geltendes Recht

Στο βαθμό που υπάρχει οποιαδήποτε αντίθεση μεταξύ τους, οι όροι των Πληροφοριών για την Άδεια Χρήσης κατισχύουν των όρων των δύο Μερών (1 και 2).

3. Χορήγηση Άδειας Χρήσης

Το Πρόγραμμα ανήκει στην IBM ή σε προμηθευτή της IBM και τα πνευματικά δικαιώματα επί του Προγράμματος είναι κατοχυρωμένα. Το Πρόγραμμα παραχωρείται με άδεια χρήσης, δεν πωλείται.

Η IBM χορηγεί στο Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης μη αποκλειστική άδεια για 1) τη χρήση του Προγράμματος έως το επίπεδο Εξουσιοδοτημένης Χρήσης που καθορίζεται στο τιμολόγιο, 2) τη δημιουργία και εγκατάσταση αντιγράφων για την υποστήριξη της εν λόγω Εξουσιοδοτημένης Χρήσης και 3) τη δημιουργία εφεδρικού ("backup") αντιγράφου, όλα τα ανωτέρω υπό την προϋπόθεση ότι ισχύουν τα εξής:

α. ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης απέκτησε το Πρόγραμμα με νόμιμο τρόπο και συμμορφώνεται με τους όρους της παρούσας Σύμβασης

β. το εφεδρικό αντίγραφο δεν χρησιμοποιείται παρά μόνο στις περιπτώσεις όπου δεν είναι δυνατή η εκτέλεση του Προγράμματος για το οποίο δημιουργήθηκε εφεδρικό αντίγραφο

γ. ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης αναπαράγει κάθε σημείωση περί πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων, καθώς και κάθε άλλη ένδειξη σχετικά με την ιδιοκτησία, σε κάθε αντίγραφο ή μερικό αντίγραφο του Προγράμματος

δ. ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης εξασφαλίζει ότι οποιοσδήποτε χρησιμοποιεί το Πρόγραμμα (είτε τοπικά είτε εξ αποστάσεως) 1) το πράττει μόνο εξ ονόματος του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης και 2) συμμορφώνεται με τους όρους της παρούσας Σύμβασης

ε. ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης δεν προβαίνει 1) στη χρήση, αντιγραφή, τροποποίηση ή διανομή του Προγράμματος, παρά μόνο στο βαθμό που ρητώς επιτρέπεται στην παρούσα Σύμβαση, 2) στην αντίστροφη συμβολομετάφραση (reverse assembling), αντίστροφη μεταγλώττιση (reverse compilation) ή κατά άλλον τρόπο μετάφραση ή αποσυμπίληση (reverse engineering) του Προγράμματος, παρά μόνο στο βαθμό που ρητώς επιτρέπεται από το νόμο χωρίς να υπάρχει η δυνατότητα συμβατικής παραίτησης από αυτό το δικαίωμα, 3) στη χρήση των λειτουργικών τμημάτων, αρχείων, ενοτήτων, οπτικοακουστικού περιεχομένου ή σχετικών κατοχυρωμένων με άδεια χρήσης υλικών του Προγράμματος χωριστά από το εν λόγω Πρόγραμμα ή 4) στην ενοικίαση ή εκμίσθωση του Προγράμματος ή στην παραχώρηση περαιτέρω αδειών χρήσης (sublicense) του Προγράμματος σε τρίτους, και

στ. εάν ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης αποκτήσει αυτό το Πρόγραμμα ως Υποστηρικτικό Πρόγραμμα, ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης θα χρησιμοποιεί αυτό το Πρόγραμμα μόνο για την υποστήριξη του Κύριου Προγράμματος και η εκ μέρους του χρήση του Προγράμματος θα υπόκειται σε οποιουσδήποτε περιορισμούς τίθενται στην άδεια χρήσης του Κύριου Προγράμματος ή, εάν ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης αποκτήσει αυτό το πρόγραμμα ως Κύριο Πρόγραμμα, ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης θα χρησιμοποιεί όλα τα Υποστηρικτικά Προγράμματα μόνο για την υποστήριξη αυτού του Προγράμματος και η εκ μέρους του χρήση των εν λόγω Προγραμμάτων θα υπόκειται σε οποιουσδήποτε περιορισμούς τίθενται στην παρούσα Σύμβαση. Για του σκοπούς του παρόντος εδαφίου "στ", "Υποστηρικτικό Πρόγραμμα" (Supporting Program) είναι ένα Πρόγραμμα που αποτελεί μέρος άλλου Προγράμματος της IBM ("Κύριο Πρόγραμμα") και το οποίο προσδιορίζεται ως Υποστηρικτικό Πρόγραμμα στις Πληροφορίες για την Άδεια Χρήσης του Κύριου Προγράμματος. (Για την απόκτηση μιας χωριστής άδειας χρήσης για ένα Υποστηρικτικό Πρόγραμμα χωρίς να ισχύουν αυτοί οι περιορισμοί, ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης θα πρέπει να απευθυνθεί στη νομική οντότητα από την οποία απέκτησε το Υποστηρικτικό Πρόγραμμα.)

Η παρούσα άδεια χρήσης ισχύει για κάθε αντίγραφο του Προγράμματος που δημιουργείται από το Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης.

3.1 Προγράμματα Αντικατάστασης, Αναβαθμίσεις, Διορθώσεις και Επιδιορθώσεις

3.1.1 Προγράμματα Αντικατάστασης (Trade-ups)

Εάν το Πρόγραμμα αντικατασταθεί από ένα Πρόγραμμα Αντικατάστασης (Trade-up Program), η άδεια χρήσης του αντικατασταθέντος Προγράμματος τερματίζεται άμεσα.

3.1.2 Αναβαθμίσεις, Διορθώσεις και Επιδιορθώσεις

Όταν ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης λάβει μια αναβάθμιση (update), διόρθωση (fix) ή επιδιόρθωση (patch) ενός Προγράμματος, ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης αποδέχεται οποιουσδήποτε πρόσθετους ή διαφορετικούς όρους που ισχύουν για την εν λόγω αναβάθμιση, διόρθωση ή επιδιόρθωση και καθορίζονται στις αντίστοιχες Πληροφορίες για την Άδεια Χρήση. Εάν δεν παρέχονται πρόσθετοι ή διαφορετικοί όροι, τότε η αναβάθμιση, διόρθωση ή επιδιόρθωση υπόκειται αποκλειστικά στους όρους της παρούσας Σύμβασης. Εάν το Πρόγραμμα αντικατασταθεί από μια αναβάθμιση, ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης συμφωνεί να τερματίσει άμεσα τη χρήση του αντικατασταθέντος Προγράμματος.

3.2 Άδειες Χρήσης Καθορισμένης Περιόδου

Εάν η IBM χορηγήσει άδεια χρήσης του Προγράμματος για καθορισμένη περίοδο, η άδεια χρήσης του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης τερματίζεται κατά τη λήξη της καθορισμένης περιόδου, εκτός εάν ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης και η IBM συμφωνήσουν στην ανανέωσή της.

3.3 Συμβατική Περίοδος και Τερματισμός

Η παρούσα Σύμβαση παραμένει σε ισχύ έως ότου τερματιστεί.

Η IBM μπορεί να τερματίσει την άδεια χρήσης του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης σε περίπτωση μη συμμόρφωσης του τελευταίου με τους όρους της παρούσας Σύμβασης.

Εάν η άδεια χρήσης τερματιστεί για οποιονδήποτε λόγο από οποιοδήποτε από τα δύο μέρη, ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης συμφωνεί να διακόψει άμεσα τη χρήση του Προγράμματος και να καταστρέψει όλα τα αντίγραφα του Προγράμματος που έχει στην κατοχή του. Οποιοιδήποτε όροι της παρούσας Σύμβασης των οποίων η ισχύς παρατείνεται από τη φύση τους πέραν του τερματισμού της Σύμβασης, παραμένουν σε ισχύ έως ότου εκπληρωθούν και ισχύουν και για τους αντίστοιχους διαδόχους και εκδοχείς κάθε ενός από τα δύο συμβαλλόμενα μέρη.

4. Χρεώσεις

Οι χρεώσεις, εάν υπάρχουν, βασίζονται στο επίπεδο Εξουσιοδοτημένης Χρήσης που αποκτήθηκε, το οποίο καθορίζεται στο τιμολόγιο. Η IBM δεν εκδίδει πιστωτικά τιμολόγια ούτε επιστρέφει χρήματα για ποσά που έχουν ήδη καταστεί απαιτητά ή έχουν καταβληθεί, εκτός εάν καθορίζεται διαφορετικά σε άλλο σημείο της παρούσας Σύμβασης.

Εάν ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης επιθυμεί να αυξήσει το επίπεδο Εξουσιοδοτημένης Χρήσης του, θα πρέπει να ενημερώσει την IBM ή κάποιον εξουσιοδοτημένο μεταπωλητή της IBM εκ των προτέρων και να καταβάλει οποιεσδήποτε σχετικές χρεώσεις.

5. Φόροι

Εάν οποιαδήποτε αρχή επιβάλει δασμό, φόρο, επιβάρυνση ή χρέωση επί του Προγράμματος, εκτός εκείνων που υπολογίζονται με βάση το καθαρό εισόδημα της IBM, τότε ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης συμφωνεί να καταβάλει το αντίστοιχο ποσό, όπως προσδιορίζεται σε σχετικό τιμολόγιο, ή να προσκομίσει έγγραφα απαλλαγής. Ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης είναι υπεύθυνος για την καταβολή οποιωνδήποτε φόρων προσωπικής περιουσίας για το Πρόγραμμα από την ημερομηνία της εκ μέρους του απόκτησης του Προγράμματος. Εάν οποιαδήποτε αρχή επιβάλει τελωνειακό δασμό, φόρο, επιβάρυνση ή χρέωση για την εισαγωγή του Προγράμματος στη χώρα ή την εξαγωγή, μεταβίβαση, προσπέλαση ή χρήση του Προγράμματος εκτός της χώρας στην οποία χορηγήθηκε η άδεια χρήσης στο Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης, τότε ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης συμφωνεί ότι είναι υπεύθυνος για την καταβολή, και θα καταβάλει, οποιοδήποτε ποσό που του επιβάλλεται.

6. Εγγύηση Επιστροφής Χρημάτων

Εάν ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης για οποιονδήποτε λόγο δεν είναι ικανοποιημένος με το Πρόγραμμα και είναι ο αρχικός Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης, τότε δικαιούται να τερματίσει την άδεια χρήσης και να λάβει επιστροφή του ποσού που τυχόν κατέβαλε για το Πρόγραμμα, υπό την προϋπόθεση ότι ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης επιστρέψει το Πρόγραμμα στη νομική οντότητα από την οποία το απέκτησε εντός 30 ημερών από την ημερομηνία έκδοσης του τιμολογίου. Αν η άδεια χρήσης είναι καθορισμένης περιόδου και υπόκειται σε ανανέωση, τότε ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης δικαιούται επιστροφή χρημάτων μόνο όταν το Πρόγραμμα επιστραφεί εντός των πρώτων 30 ημερών της αρχικής περιόδου. Εάν ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης είχε μεταφορτώσει το Πρόγραμμα από το Διαδίκτυο, τότε ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης πρέπει να επικοινωνήσει με τη νομική οντότητα από την οποία απέκτησε το Πρόγραμμα για οδηγίες σχετικά με το πώς θα του επιστραφούν τα χρήματα που κατέβαλε.

7. Μεταβίβαση Προγράμματος

Ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης μπορεί να μεταβιβάσει το Πρόγραμμα και όλα τα δικαιώματα και τις υποχρεώσεις του που προβλέπονται στην άδεια χρήσης του Προγράμματος, σε άλλο μέρος εφόσον το άλλο μέρος αποδεχθεί τους όρους της παρούσας Σύμβασης. Εάν η άδεια χρήσης τερματιστεί για οποιονδήποτε λόγο από οποιοδήποτε από τα δύο μέρη, ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης δεν δικαιούται να μεταβιβάσει το Πρόγραμμα σε άλλο μέρος. Ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης δεν δικαιούται να μεταβιβάσει μέρος 1) του Προγράμματος ή 2) της Εξουσιοδοτημένης Χρήσης του Προγράμματος. Όταν ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης μεταβιβάσει το Πρόγραμμα, θα πρέπει επίσης να μεταβιβάσει έντυπο αντίγραφο της παρούσας Σύμβασης, συμπεριλαμβανομένων και των Πληροφοριών για την Άδεια Χρήσης. Αμέσως μετά την ολοκλήρωση της μεταβίβασης, η άδεια χρήσης του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης τερματίζεται.

9. Δεδομένα και Βάσεις Δεδομένων του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης

Για να είναι σε θέση να βοηθήσει το Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης στην απομόνωση της αιτίας ενός προβλήματος με το Πρόγραμμα, η IBM μπορεί να ζητήσει από το Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης 1) να επιτρέψει στην IBM την εξ αποστάσεως πρόσβαση στο σύστημα του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης ή 2) να στείλει πληροφορίες ή δεδομένα συστήματος του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης στην IBM. Όμως, η IBM δεν είναι υποχρεωμένη να παρέχει τέτοια βοήθεια, εκτός εάν η IBM και ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης προβούν στη σύναψη χωριστής έγγραφης σύμβασης βάσει της οποίας η IBM να συμφωνεί να παρέχει στο Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης τέτοιου είδους υποστήριξη, η οποία είναι εκτός των υποχρεώσεων της IBM βάσει της παρούσας Σύμβασης. Σε κάθε περίπτωση, η IBM χρησιμοποιεί τις πληροφορίες για σφάλματα και προβλήματα μόνο για τη βελτίωση των προϊόντων και των υπηρεσιών της και για την καλύτερη παροχή των σχετικών της προσφορών υποστήριξης. Για την εξυπηρέτηση αυτών των σκοπών, η IBM μπορεί να χρησιμοποιεί νομικά πρόσωπα IBM και υπεργολάβους της (συμπεριλαμβανομένων και νομικών προσώπων IBM και υπεργολάβων σε μία ή περισσότερες χώρες εκτός της χώρας στην οποία ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης έχει την έδρα του) και ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης εξουσιοδοτεί την IBM να το πράξει.

Ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης παραμένει υπεύθυνος για 1) οποιαδήποτε δεδομένα και το περιεχόμενο οποιασδήποτε βάσης δεδομένων που ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης καθιστά διαθέσιμη στην IBM, 2) την επιλογή και εφαρμογή διαδικασιών και ελέγχων αναφορικά με την προσπέλαση, ασφάλεια, κρυπτογράφηση, χρήση και μετάδοση δεδομένων (συμπεριλαμβανομένων και πληροφοριών στις οποίες δηλώνεται ή από τις οποίες μπορεί να προκύψει η ταυτότητα συγκεκριμένων προσώπων) και 3) την εφεδρική αποθήκευση (backup) και αποκατάσταση οποιασδήποτε βάσης δεδομένων και οποιωνδήποτε αποθηκευμένων δεδομένων. Ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης δεν θα αποστέλλει και δεν θα παρέχει στην IBM πρόσβαση σε πληροφορίες στις οποίες δηλώνεται ή από τις οποίες μπορεί να προκύψει η ταυτότητα συγκεκριμένων προσώπων, είτε σε μορφή δεδομένων είτε σε οποιαδήποτε άλλη μορφή, και θα φέρει την ευθύνη για εύλογες δαπάνες και άλλα ποσά με τα οποία μπορεί να επιβαρυνθεί η ΙΒΜ σε συνάρτηση με την εσφαλμένη παροχή τέτοιων πληροφοριών στην IBM ή την απώλεια ή αποκάλυψη τέτοιων πληροφοριών από την IBM, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των δαπανών που απορρέουν από αξιώσεις τρίτων.

10. Περιορισμός Ευθύνης

Οι περιορισμοί και οι εξαιρέσεις που ορίζονται στο παρόν Άρθρο 10 (Περιορισμός Ευθύνης) έχουν πλήρη ισχύ στο βαθμό που δεν απαγορεύονται από το εφαρμοστέο δίκαιο χωρίς να υπάρχει δυνατότητα συμβατικής παραίτησης από τα αντίστοιχα δικαιώματα.

10.1 Στοιχεία για τα οποία ενδέχεται να φέρει ευθύνη η IBM

Ενδέχεται να προκύψουν περιστάσεις κατά τις οποίες, λόγω αθέτησης συμβατικής υποχρέωσης εκ μέρους της IBM ή λόγω άλλης ευθύνης, ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης δικαιούται να λάβει αποζημίωση από την IBM. Ανεξάρτητα από τη βάση επί της οποίας ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης δικαιούται να εγείρει αξίωση αποζημίωσης κατά της IBM (συμπεριλαμβανομένης της αθέτησης ουσιωδών συμβατικών όρων, αμέλειας, ψευδούς δήλωσης ή άλλης αξίωσης που απορρέει από σύμβαση ή αδικοπραξία), η συνολική ευθύνη της IBM για όλες τις αξιώσεις, σωρευτικά, που απορρέουν από ή σχετίζονται με κάθε Πρόγραμμα ή κατά άλλον τρόπο προκύπτουν από την παρούσα Σύμβαση, δεν θα υπερβαίνει το ποσό 1) της αποζημίωσης για σωματική βλάβη (συμπεριλαμβανομένου θανάτου) και της αποζημίωσης κινητής και ακίνητης ατομικής περιουσίας και 2) οποιασδήποτε άλλης θετικής άμεσης ζημίας, έως το ποσό των χρεώσεων (εάν το Πρόγραμμα υπόκειται σε χρεώσεις καθορισμένης περιόδου, έως το ποσό των χρεώσεων 12 μηνών) που ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης κατέβαλε για το Πρόγραμμα που αποτελεί αντικείμενο της αξίωσης.

Το όριο αυτό ισχύει επίσης για οποιεσδήποτε εταιρείες ανάπτυξης Προγραμμάτων και προμηθευτές της IBM. Είναι η μέγιστη ευθύνη που φέρουν συλλογικά η IBM, οι εταιρείες ανάπτυξης Προγραμμάτων της και οι προμηθευτές της.

10.2 Στοιχεία για τα οποία δεν φέρει ευθύνη η IBM

ΣΕ ΚΑΜΙΑ ΠΕΡΙΠΤΩΣΗ ΔΕΝ ΦΕΡΟΥΝ ΕΥΘΥΝΗ Η IBM, ΟΙ ΠΡΟΜΗΘΕΥΤΕΣ ΤΗΣ Ή ΟΙ ΕΤΑΙΡΕΙΕΣ ΑΝΑΠΤΥΞΗΣ ΠΡΟΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΩΝ ΜΕ ΤΙΣ ΟΠΟΙΕΣ ΣΥΝΕΡΓΑΖΕΤΑΙ ΓΙΑ ΟΠΟΙΟΔΗΠΟΤΕ ΑΠΟ ΤΑ ΑΚΟΛΟΥΘΑ, ΑΚΟΜΑ ΚΑΙ ΑΝ ΕΧΟΥΝ ΕΝΗΜΕΡΩΘΕΙ ΓΙΑ ΤΗΝ ΠΙΘΑΝΟΤΗΤΑ ΝΑ ΠΡΟΚΥΨΟΥΝ:

α. ΑΠΩΛΕΙΑ Ή ΦΘΟΡΑ ΔΕΔΟΜΕΝΩΝ

β. ΕΙΔΙΚΕΣ, ΠΑΡΕΠΟΜΕΝΕΣ Ή ΕΜΜΕΣΕΣ ΖΗΜΙΕΣ, ΑΠΟΖΗΜΙΩΣΗ ΓΙΑ ΗΘΙΚΗ ΒΛΑΒΗ Ή ΟΠΟΙΕΣΔΗΠΟΤΕ ΟΙΚΟΝΟΜΙΚΕΣ ΑΠΟΘΕΤΙΚΕΣ ΖΗΜΙΕΣ, Ή

γ. ΔΙΑΦΥΓΟΝΤΑ ΚΕΡΔΗ, ΑΠΩΛΕΙΑ ΕΠΙΧΕΙΡΗΜΑΤΙΚΩΝ ΔΡΑΣΤΗΡΙΟΤΗΤΩΝ, ΕΣΟΔΩΝ, ΆΥΛΗΣ ΕΜΠΟΡΙΚΗΣ ΑΞΙΑΣ Ή ΠΡΟΣΔΟΚΩΜΕΝΩΝ ΚΕΡΔΩΝ.

11. Επαλήθευση Συμμόρφωσης

Για τους σκοπούς του παρόντος Άρθρου 11 (Επαλήθευση Συμμόρφωσης), με τον όρο "Όροι Προγραμμάτων ILAN" νοούνται 1) η παρούσα Σύμβαση και οι αντίστοιχες τροποποιήσεις και έγγραφα συναλλαγών που παρέχονται από την IBM και 2) οι πολιτικές λογισμικού (software policies) της IBM, οι οποίες περιγράφονται στο δικτυακό τόπο IBM Software Policy (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), συμπεριλαμβανομένων, ενδεικτικά και όχι περιοριστικά, των πολιτικών περί εφεδρικής υποστήριξης (backup), τιμολόγησης μειωμένης δυναμικότητας (sub-capacity pricing) και μετάπτωσης (migration).

Τα δικαιώματα και οι υποχρεώσεις που καθορίζονται στο παρόν Άρθρο 11 παραμένουν σε ισχύ κατά τη διάρκεια της χρονικής περιόδου για την οποία έχει χορηγηθεί άδεια χρήσης του Προγράμματος στο Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης, συν δύο επιπλέον έτη μετά τη λήξη της εν λόγω περιόδου.

11.1 Διαδικασία Επαλήθευσης

Ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης συμφωνεί να δημιουργεί, να τηρεί και να παρέχει στην IBM και τους ελεγκτές της ακριβή έγγραφα στοιχεία, αποτελέσματα εργαλείων του συστήματος και άλλα δεδομένα του συστήματος τα οποία επαρκούν προκειμένου να παράσχουν τη δυνατότητα επαλήθευσης, η οποία θα υπόκειται σε έλεγχο, ότι η χρήση όλων των Προγραμμάτων εκ μέρους του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης συμμορφώνεται με τους Όρους Προγραμμάτων ILAN, συμπεριλαμβανομένων, ενδεικτικά και όχι περιοριστικά, όλων των σχετικών όρων της IBM περί προϋποθέσεων τιμολόγησης και χορήγησης αδειών χρήσης. Ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης είναι υπεύθυνος 1) να εξασφαλίζει ότι δεν υπερβαίνει το επίπεδο Εξουσιοδοτημένης Χρήσης του και 2) να εξακολουθεί να συμμορφώνεται με τους Όρους Προγραμμάτων ILAN.

Μετά από εύλογη ειδοποίηση, η IBM μπορεί να ελέγξει τη συμμόρφωση του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης με τους Όρους Προγραμμάτων ILAN σε όλες τις τοποθεσίες και για όλα τα περιβάλλοντα στα οποία ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης χρησιμοποιεί (για οποιονδήποτε σκοπό) Προγράμματα που υπόκεινται στους Όρους Προγραμμάτων ILAN. Η εν λόγω επαλήθευση θα διεξάγεται με τρόπο που να ελαχιστοποιεί το ενδεχόμενο πρόκλησης αναστάτωσης στην επιχείρηση του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης και μπορεί να διεξάγεται στις εγκαταστάσεις του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης, κατά το κανονικό εργάσιμο ωράριο. Η IBM μπορεί να χρησιμοποιήσει ανεξάρτητο ελεγκτή για την παροχή βοήθειας κατά Ειδοποιήσεις για Κώδικα, υπό την προϋπόθεση ότι η IBM έχει συνάψει έγγραφη σύμβαση εμπιστευτικότητας με τον εν λόγω ελεγκτή.

11.2 Επίλυση

Η IBM θα ειδοποιεί το Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης εγγράφως εάν κατά την πραγματοποίηση τέτοιας επαλήθευσης διαπιστωθεί ότι ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης έχει χρησιμοποιήσει οποιοδήποτε Πρόγραμμα πέραν του επιπέδου Εξουσιοδοτημένης Χρήσης του ή κατά άλλον τρόπο δεν συμμορφώνεται με τους Όρους Προγραμμάτων ILAN. Ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης συμφωνεί να καταβάλλει χωρίς καθυστέρηση απευθείας στην IBM τις χρεώσεις που καθορίζονται από την IBM σε ένα τιμολόγιο για 1) οποιαδήποτε τέτοια πρόσθετη χρήση, 2) υποστήριξη για την εν λόγω πρόσθετη χρήση για τη διάρκεια της πρόσθετης χρήσης ή για περίοδο δύο ετών, όποια από τις δύο περιόδους αυτές είναι μικρότερη και 3) οποιεσδήποτε χρεώσεις και άλλες οφειλές που τυχόν καθοριστούν ως αποτέλεσμα της εν λόγω επαλήθευσης.

12. Ειδοποιήσεις για Κώδικα Τρίτων

Το Πρόγραμμα μπορεί να περιέχει κώδικα τρίτων προμηθευτών (third party code) για τον οποίο η IBM, και όχι ο τρίτος προμηθευτής, χορηγεί άδειας χρήσης στο Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης βάσει τον όρων της παρούσας Σύμβασης. Οποιεσδήποτε ειδοποιήσεις σχετικά με τον κώδικα τρίτων προμηθευτών ("Ειδοποιήσεις για Κώδικα Τρίτων") συμπεριλαμβάνονται μόνο για την πληροφόρηση του Δικαιούχου Άδειας Χρήσης.

Στις Ειδοποιήσεις για Κώδικα Τρίτων παρέχονται πληροφορίες σχετικά με τον τρόπο απόκτησης πηγαίου κώδικα αναφορικά με τον κώδικα κάποιων τρίτων προμηθευτών. Εάν στις Ειδοποιήσεις για Κώδικα Τρίτων κάποιος κώδικας τρίτων προμηθευτών προσδιορίζεται από την IBM ως "Τροποποιήσιμος Κώδικας Τρίτων" ("Modifiable Third Party Code"), η IBM εξουσιοδοτεί το Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης 1) να τροποποιήσει τον Τροποποιήσιμο Κώδικα Τρίτων και 2) να προβεί στην αποσυμπίληση (reverse engineering) των ενοτήτων του Προγράμματος που συνδέονται άμεσα με τον Τροποποιήσιμο Κώδικα Τρίτων, υπό την προϋπόθεση ότι η εν λόγω αποσυμπίληση πραγματοποιείται μόνο για το σκοπό της αποσφαλμάτωσης (debugging) των τροποποιήσεων που πραγματοποίησε ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης στον εν λόγω κώδικα τρίτων.

στ. Κάθε ένα από τα δύο μέρη θα παράσχει στο άλλο εύλογη ευχέρεια να συμμορφωθεί προς τις υποχρεώσεις του προτού ισχυριστεί ότι το άλλο μέρος δεν ανταποκρίθηκε στις υποχρεώσεις του βάσει της παρούσας Σύμβασης. Τα δύο μέρη θα επιχειρούν να επιλύουν καλόπιστα οποιεσδήποτε διαφορές, διαφωνίες ή αξιώσεις μεταξύ των δύο μερών αναφορικά με την παρούσα Σύμβαση.

ζ. Εκτός εάν άλλως απαιτείται από το εφαρμοστέο δίκαιο χωρίς να υπάρχει δυνατότητα συμβατικής παραίτησης ή περιορισμού αυτού του δικαιώματος: 1) κανένα από τα δύο μέρη δεν θα εγείρει αγωγή οποιασδήποτε μορφής για οποιαδήποτε αξίωση η οποία απορρέει από ή σχετίζεται με την παρούσα Σύμβαση μετά την πάροδο διετίας από την ημερομηνία κατά την οποία προέκυψε η αιτία έγερσης της αγωγής και 2) μετά τη λήξη της εν λόγω χρονικής προθεσμίας, οποιαδήποτε τέτοια αξίωση και όλα τα δικαιώματα που σχετίζονται με την εν λόγω αξίωση θα παραγραφούν.

ι. Προβαίνοντας στη σύναψη της παρούσας Σύμβασης, κανένα από τα δύο μέρη δεν βασίζεται σε οποιεσδήποτε δηλώσεις που δεν καθορίζονται στην παρούσα Σύμβαση, συμπεριλαμβανομένων, ενδεικτικά και όχι περιοριστικά, οποιωνδήποτε δηλώσεων σχετικά με: 1) την απόδοση ή λειτουργία του Προγράμματος, 2) τις εμπειρίες ή υποδείξεις άλλων μερών ή 3) οποιαδήποτε αποτελέσματα ή οικονομίες που μπορεί να επιτύχει ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης.

Οι Εμπορικοί Συνεργάτες της IBM εξακολουθούν να είναι ανεξάρτητοι οργανισμοί που λειτουργούν χωριστά από την IBM. Η IBM δεν είναι υπεύθυνη για τις πράξεις ή τις δηλώσεις Εμπορικών Συνεργατών της IBM ή για την εκπλήρωση των υποχρεώσεων που έχουν προς το Δικαιούχο Άδειας Χρήσης.

ιβ. Οι όροι περί αδειών χρήσης και αποζημίωσης για πνευματική ιδιοκτησία που περιλαμβάνονται σε άλλες συμβάσεις που έχει συνάψει ο Δικαιούχος Άδειας Χρήσης με την IBM (όπως π.χ. η Σύμβαση Πελατών IBM) δεν ισχύουν για άδειες χρήσης Προγραμμάτων που χορηγούνται βάσει της παρούσας Σύμβασης.

ιγ. Και τα δύο μέρη συμφωνούν ότι όλες οι ανταλλασσόμενες πληροφορίες είναι μη εμπιστευτικές. Εάν κάποιο από τα δύο μέρη ζητήσει την ανταλλαγή εμπιστευτικών πληροφοριών, αυτή θα πραγματοποιηθεί βάσει υπογεγραμμένης σύμβασης ανταλλαγής εμπιστευτικών πληροφοριών.

9. Datos y Bases de Datos del Licenciatario

Para ayudar al Licenciatario a aislar el origen de un problema con el Programa, IBM podrá solicitar que el Licenciatario: 1) permita que IBM acceda de forma remota al sistema del Licenciatario, o 2) envíe información sobre el Licenciatario o datos del sistema a IBM. No obstante, IBM no está obligada a proporcionar dicha asistencia a menos que las Partes tengan un acuerdo, independiente y por escrito, mediante el cual IBM proporcione al Licenciatario dicho tipo de soporte que no está incluido en las obligaciones de IBM en este Acuerdo. En cualquier caso, IBM utilizará la información sobre errores y problemas para mejorar sus productos y servicios así como para prestar asistencia con su oferta de servicios de mantenimiento relacionados. Con esa finalidad, IBM podrá utilizar a subcontratistas y Empresas IBM (incluyendo en uno o más países distintos del país en el que se encuentra el Licenciatario) y el Licenciatario autoriza a IBM para ello.

El Licenciatario permanecerá responsable de: 1) los datos y contenidos de cualquier base de datos que el Licenciatario ponga a disposición de IBM, 2) la selección y la implementación de los procedimientos y controles relacionados con el acceso, seguridad, encriptación, uso y transmisión de los datos (incluyendo cualquier dato personal que pueda identificarse), y 3) las copias de seguridad y la recuperación de cualquier base de datos y de cualquier dato almacenado.

10.1 Aspectos por los que IBM Puede Ser Responsable

Pueden surgir circunstancias en las cuales, debido a un incumplimiento de IBM de sus obligaciones contractuales u otra responsabilidad, el Licenciatario tuviera derecho a reclamar daños a IBM. Independientemente de las razones por las que el Licenciatario tenga derecho a reclamar daños a IBM (incluyendo un incumplimiento, negligencia, falsedad u otra reclamación contractual o extracontractual), la responsabilidad de IBM por todas las reclamaciones que surjan de, en relación con, cada Programa o que de otra manera surjan en relación con este Acuerdo estará limitada únicamente a: 1) los daños físicos a las personas (incluyendo la muerte) y daños a las propiedades, y 2) otros daños directos probados hasta el importe de los cargos (si el Programa está sujeto a cargos de plazo determinado, hasta el importe de los cargos de doce meses) que ha pagado el Licenciatario por el Programa que sea objeto de la reclamación.

Este límite se aplica también a cualquier proveedor o desarrollador de Programas de IBM. Es la cantidad máxima por la que IBM y sus proveedores y desarrolladores de Programas serán responsables colectivamente.

10.2 Aspectos por los que IBM No Es Responsable

h. Ninguna de las partes será responsable del incumplimiento de cualquier obligación debido a causas fuera de control.

i. Este Acuerdo no creará derecho alguno o causa de demanda para ningún tercero, ni IBM será responsable de las reclamaciones al Cliente de terceros, salvo por lo especificado en la Cláusula 10.1 "Aspectos por los que IBM Puede Ser Responsable" en relación con daños a las personas (incluyendo muerte) y a las propiedades de las que IBM sea legalmente responsable frente a dichos terceros.

9. Données et bases de données appartenant au Détenteur de la licence

Pour aider le Détenteur de la licence à identifier la cause d'un problème lié au Logiciel, IBM peut demander à ce que le Détenteur de la licence 1) autorise IBM à accéder à distance au système du Détenteur de la licence ; ou 2) envoie les données système ou les informations du Détenteur de la licence à IBM. Toutefois, IBM n'est pas tenue de fournir une telle assistance à moins qu'IBM et le Détenteur de la licence en aient convenu autrement dans le cadre d'un accord distinct où IBM s'engage à fournir au Détenteur de la licence une assistance de ce type, qui dépasse les obligations d'IBM au titre du présent Contrat. Dans tous les cas, IBM utilisera les informations concernant les erreurs et les problèmes dans le but d'améliorer ses produits et services, et de fournir des offres de support associées. Dans ce contexte, le Détenteur de la licence autorise IBM à faire appel à des sous-traitants et des entités IBM (y compris dans un ou plusieurs pays autres que celui où réside le Détenteur de la licence).

Le Détenteur de la licence sera responsable 1) des données et du contenu des bases de données que le Détenteur de la licence mettra à la disposition d'IBM, 2) du choix et de la mise en oeuvre des procédures et des contrôles régissant l'accès, la sécurité, le chiffrement, l'utilisation ainsi que la transmission des données (notamment les données d'identification personnelle) ; et 3) de la sauvegarde et de la reprise des bases de données et des données éventuellement stockées. Le Détenteur de la licence ne transmettra et ne fournira à IBM aucun accès à des informations d'identification personnelle, qu'elles soient ou non sous forme de données. En outre, il sera redevable des coûts raisonnables ainsi que des sommes qu'IBM pourrait subir au titre des informations fournies à IBM par erreur ou encore de la perte ou de la divulgation desdites informations par IBM, y compris celles découlant de réclamations émanant de tiers.

10. Limitation de responsabilité

Les limitations et exclusions énoncées dans cette Section 10 (Limitation de responsabilité) s'appliquent sous réserve qu'elles ne soient pas interdites par une loi locale à laquelle il ne peut être dérogé contractuellement.

10.1 Cas pour lesquels IBM peut être responsable

Dans certaines circonstances, le Détenteur de la licence peut être en droit, en raison d'un manquement de la part d'IBM ou d'une autre forme de responsabilité, de réclamer des dommages-intérêts à IBM. Quel que soit le fondement de l'action que le Détenteur de la licence engage contre IBM (notamment pour violation d'une condition essentielle de ce Contrat, négligence, tromperie ou autre faute contractuelle), la responsabilité d'IBM vis-à-vis de l'ensemble des réclamations découlant de ou liés à chaque Logiciel ou découlant de quelque autre manière du présent Contrat sera limitée au montant 1) des dommages corporels (y compris le décès) et des dommages aux biens matériels, mobiliers et immobiliers ; et 2) tout autre dommage direct et réel plafonné au montant des redevances (jusqu'à 12 mois de redevances si le Logiciel est concédé sous une licence à durée limitée), payées par le Détenteur de la licence pour le Logiciel à l'origine de la réclamation.

Cette limite s'applique également aux développeurs et fournisseurs d'un Logiciel IBM. C'est le maximum pour lequel IBM, ses développeurs de logiciels et ses sous-traitants sont collectivement responsables.

10.2 Cas pour lesquels IBM n'est pas responsable

IBM, SES DÉVELOPPEURS OU FOURNISSEURS NE PEUVENT EN AUCUN CAS ÊTRE TENUS RESPONSABLES DES DOMMAGES SUIVANTS, ET CE, MÊME S'ILS ONT ÉTÉ INFORMÉS DE LEUR POSSIBLE SURVENANCE :

a. PERTE OU DÉTÉRIORATION DE VOS DONNÉES ;

b. PRÉJUDICES MORAUX, ACCESSOIRES OU INDIRECTS ; OU

c. PERTE DE BÉNÉFICE, D'ACTIVITÉ COMMERCIALE, DE REVENU, DE CLIENTÈLE, OU D'ÉCONOMIES ESCOMPTÉES.

11. Vérification de Conformité

Dans le contexte de cette section 11 (Vérification de Conformité), le terme "Dispositions ILAN du Logiciel" désigne 1) le présent Contrat ainsi que les avenants et les documents de transaction applicables fournis par IBM ; et 2) les politiques d'IBM en matière de logiciels pouvant figurer sur le site Internet IBM Software Policy (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), y compris, et de façon non limitative, les règles en matière de sauvegarde, de tarification et de migration.

Les droits et obligations décrits dans cette section 11 demeurent en vigueur pendant toute la durée où le Logiciel a été concédé au Détenteur de la licence, ainsi que pendant les deux (2) années qui suivent cette période.

11.1 Processus de vérification

Le Détenteur de la licence s'engage à créer, conserver et fournir à IBM et ses auditeurs tous les enregistrements, les sorties d'outils système et toute autre information système exacts que ce soit sur papier ou sous forme électronique, afin de démontrer à IBM que l'utilisation que le Détenteur de la licence fait de tous les Logiciels est conforme aux Dispositions ILAN du Logiciel, y compris, et de façon non limitative, les dispositions d'IBM applicables tant à la licence qu'aux conditions d'éligibilité à certaines tarifications. Le Détenteur de la licence sera chargé de 1) s'assurer qu'il ne dépasse pas le niveau d'Utilisation Autorisée qui lui a été accordé ; et de 2) rester en conformité avec les Dispositions ILAN du Logiciel.

Moyennant un préavis de 30 jours, IBM se réserve le droit de vérifier que le Détenteur de la licence se conforme aux Dispositions ILAN du Logiciel dans chacun des sites et pour tous les environnements où le Détenteur de la licence utilise (à n'importe quelle fin) les Logiciels couverts par les Dispositions ILAN du Logiciel. Ces vérifications seront effectuées de façon à gêner le moins possible les activités du Détenteur de la licence. En outre, elles pourront être réalisées dans les locaux du Détenteur de la licence durant les heures normales de travail. Pour ce faire, IBM pourra utiliser un auditeur extérieur, sous réserve qu'un accord de confidentialité ait été signé entre IBM et cet auditeur.

11.2 Résolution

À l'issue desdites vérifications, IBM indiquera par écrit au Détenteur de la licence s'il a utilisé le Logiciel au-delà du niveau d'Utilisation Autorisée qui lui a été accordé ou s'il est au contraire en conformité avec les Dispositions ILAN du Logiciel. Le Détenteur de la licence s'engage à régler dans les plus brefs délais à IBM les frais qui pourraient lui être imputés par IBM dans une facture pour 1) toute utilisation du Logiciel au-delà du niveau d'Utilisation Autorisée qui lui a été accordé ; 2) prendre en charge une telle utilisation excessive pour la durée la plus courte d'une telle utilisation ou pour deux (2) années ; et 3) tous les frais supplémentaires et obligations de paiement qu'il pourrait être tenu de respecter à l'égard de ce contrôle.

12. Mentions relatives au code tiers

Le Logiciel peut inclure du code tiers qu'IBM, et non pas la partie tierce, concède sous licence au Détenteur de la licence dans le cadre du présent Contrat. Si le code tiers est accompagné de mentions spécifiques ("Mentions relatives au code tiers"), elles sont uniquement indiquées à titre de référence pour le Détenteur de la licence. Ces mentions peuvent résider dans le ou les fichiers NOTICES du Logiciel. Les Mentions relatives au code tiers contiennent des instructions expliquant comment obtenir le code source de certains codes tiers. Si IBM qualifie le code tiers comme étant un "Code tiers modifiable" dans les Mentions relatives au code tiers, elle autorise le Détenteur de la licence à 1) modifier le Code tiers modifiable ; et à 2) faire de l'ingénierie inverse sur les modules du Logiciel qui sont directement liés au Code tiers modifiable mais dans le seul but de déboguer les modifications que le Détenteur de la licence a apportées audit code tiers. Si des obligations de service et de support incombent à IBM, elles ne s'appliquent qu'au Logiciel non modifié.

13. Dispositions générales

a. Le présent Contrat ne porte atteinte à aucune des dispositions légales d'ordre public relatives aux droits des consommateurs.

b. En ce qui concerne les Logiciels qu'IBM fournit au Détenteur de la licence sous une forme tangible, IBM honore ses obligations d'expédition et de livraison au moment où IBM remet lesdits Logiciels au transporteur désigné par IBM, sauf autorisation écrite contraire unissant le Détenteur de la licence et IBM.

c. Si l'une des dispositions du présent Contrat est considérée comme nulle ou inapplicable, elle n'entraînera pas la nullité des autres dispositions.

d. Le Détenteur de la licence s'engage à respecter toutes les lois et réglementations applicables en matière d'exportation et d'importation, y compris celles soumises à l'embargo des États-Unis concernant l'exportation de produits destinés à certains usages ou à certains utilisateurs.

e. Le Détenteur de la licence autorise IBM et ses filiales (ainsi que ses ayants droit et cessionnaires, sous-traitants et Partenaires commerciaux IBM) à stocker et à utiliser les coordonnées des contacts professionnels du Détenteur de la licence à l'endroit où ils font des affaires, en relation avec les produits et services IBM, ou le bon fonctionnement des relations d'affaires entre IBM et le Détenteur de la licence.

f. Avant de formuler une réclamation, chaque partie accordera à l'autre un délai raisonnable pour remplir ses obligations au titre du présent Contrat. Les deux parties mettront en oeuvre tous les efforts raisonnables afin de résoudre les litiges, désaccords ou réclamations pouvant les opposer au titre du présent Contrat.

g. Sauf disposition légale ou réglementaire contraire à laquelle il ne peut être dérogé contractuellement : 1) aucune des parties n'intentera d'action en justice, sous quelque forme que ce soit, à l'égard d'une réclamation découlant du ou liée au présent Contrat plus de deux ans après l'apparition de son fait générateur ; et 2) à l'expiration de ladite période, toute réclamation et tout droit applicable lié à ladite revendication seront déclarés caducs.

h. Ni le Détenteur de la licence, ni IBM ne sera responsable d'un manquement à ses obligations si un tel manquement résulte d'un cas de force majeure.

i. Le présent Contrat ne crée aucun droit et ne contient aucune stipulation pour autrui au profit d'un tiers. En outre, IBM ne sera pas tenue responsable des réclamations émanant de tiers à l'encontre du Détenteur de la licence, sauf disposition contraire dans la sous-section 10.1 (Cas pour lesquels IBM peut être responsable), allant au-delà des dommages corporels (y compris le décès) ou des dommages aux biens matériels, mobiliers et immobiliers, pour lesquels IBM est légalement responsable envers ledit tiers.

j. En concluant le présent Contrat, les parties renoncent à tout engagement non expressément prévu dans le présent Contrat, y compris, et de façon non limitative, toute déclaration concernant 1) les performances ou le fonctionnement du Logiciel ; 2) les expériences et recommandations de parties tierces ; ou 3) les résultats ou économies que le Détenteur de la licence pourrait obtenir.

k. IBM a signé des contrats avec certaines entités commerciales ("Partenaires Commerciaux IBM") pour promouvoir, commercialiser et fournir certains Logiciels. Les Partenaires commerciaux IBM restent indépendants et distincts d'IBM. IBM n'est pas responsable des actions ou déclarations faites par les Partenaires commerciaux IBM, ni des obligations qu'ils ont vis-à-vis du Détenteur de la licence.

l. Les dispositions d'indemnisation au titre des licences et de la propriété intellectuelle figurant dans les accords éventuellement conclus entre IBM et le Détenteur de la licence (comme le Livret contractuel IBM, par exemple) ne s'appliquent pas aux licences de Logiciel qui sont concédées dans le présent Contrat.

m. Les informations échangées entre les deux parties sont réputées non confidentielles. Tout échange d'informations confidentielles effectué à la demande de l'une des parties interviendra dans le cadre d'un accord de confidentialité dûment signé.

14. Étendue géographique et droit applicable

* SEGERA MENGEMBALIKAN MEDIA DAN DOKUMENTASI YANG TIDAK TERPAKAI KEPADA PIHAK DARI MANA ANDA MENDAPATKANNYA UNTUK SUATU PENGEMBALIAN UANG ATAS JUMLAH YANG TELAH DIBAYARKAN. APABILA PROGRAM TELAH DIUNDUH, MUSNAHKAN SEMUA SALINAN PROGRAM.

1. Definisi

"Penggunaan yang Sah" - tingkat yang ditetapkan di mana Pemegang Lisensi berhak untuk melaksanakan atau menjalankan Program. Tingkat tersebut dapat diukur berdasarkan jumlah pengguna, jutaan unit layanan ("MSU"), Unit Nilai Prosesor ("PVU") atau tingkat penggunaan lainnya yang ditetapkan oleh IBM.

"IBM" - International Business Machines Corporation atau salah satu anak perusahaannya.

"Informasi tentang Lisensi" ("IL") - dokumen yang memberikan informasi dan syarat-syarat tambahan yang dikhususkan untuk Program. IL Program tersedia di www.ibm.com/software/sla. IL juga dapat dilihat dalam direktori Program dengan menggunakan perintah sistem atau sebagai buklet yang dimasukkan bersama dengan Program.

"Program" - hal-hal berikut ini, termasuk asli dan seluruh atau sebagian salinan: 1) instruksi dan data yang dapat dibaca oleh mesin, 2) komponen, berkas, dan modul, 3) konten audio-visual (seperti gambar, teks, rekaman atau foto), dan 4) materi yang dilisensikan terkait (seperti kunci dan dokumentasi).

2. Susunan Perjanjian

Perjanjian ini termasuk Bagian 1 - Syarat-syarat Umum, Bagian 2 - Syarat-syarat Khusus Tiap Negara (apabila ada) dan IL dan merupakan perjanjian yang lengkap antara Pemegang Lisensi dan IBM tentang penggunaan Program. Perjanjian ini menggantikan setiap komunikasi lisan atau tertulis sebelumnya antara Pemegang Lisensi dan IBM tentang penggunaan Program oleh Pemegang Lisensi. Syarat-syarat Bagian 2 dapat menggantikan atau memodifikasi syarat-syarat Bagian 1. Sepanjang terdapat ketidaksesuaian, IL berlaku atas kedua Bagian tersebut.

3. Pemberian Lisensi

Program adalah milik IBM atau pemasok IBM serta diberi hak cipta dan lisensi, tetapi tidak dijual.

IBM memberikan lisensi yang tidak eksklusif kepada Pemegang Lisensi untuk 1) menggunakan Program sampai dengan Penggunaan yang Sah sebagaimana ditetapkan dalam tagihan, 2) membuat dan memasang salinan-salinan untuk mendukung Penggunaan yang Sah tersebut, dan 3) membuat salinan cadangan, semua dengan ketentuan bahwa

a. Pemegang Lisensi telah mendapatkan Program secara sah dan mematuhi syarat-syarat Perjanjian ini;

b. salinan cadangan tidak bekerja kecuali apabila Program yang dicadangkan tidak dapat bekerja;

c. Pemegang Lisensi mereproduksi semua pemberitahuan tentang hak cipta dan keterangan kepemilikan lainnya dalam masing-masing salinan atau sebagian salinan Program;

d. Pemegang Lisensi memastikan bahwa setiap individu yang menggunakan Program (yang diakses dari jarak dekat atau jarak jauh) 1) melakukan hal tersebut hanya atas nama Pemegang Lisensi dan 2) mematuhi syarat-syarat Perjanjian ini;

e. Pemegang Lisensi tidak 1) menggunakan, menyalin, memodifikasi, atau mendistribusikan Program kecuali apabila diizinkan secara tegas dalam Perjanjian ini; 2) merakit kembali, menyusun kembali, dengan cara lain, menerjemahkan atau merekayasa kembali Program, kecuali apabila diizinkan secara tegas oleh undang-undang tanpa adanya kemungkinan pelepasan kontrak; 3) menggunakan setiap komponen, berkas, modul, konten audio-visual atau materi yang dilisensikan terkait yang terpisah dari Program tersebut; atau 4) mensublisensikan, menyewa atau menyewakan Program; dan

f. apabila Pemegang Lisensi mendapatkan Program ini sebagai Program Pendukung, Pemegang Lisensi menggunakan Program ini hanya untuk mendukung Program Utama dan tunduk kepada setiap batasan dalam lisensi untuk Program Utama, atau, apabila Pemegang Lisensi mendapatkan Program ini sebagai Program Utama, Pemegang Lisensi menggunakan semua Program Pendukung hanya untuk mendukung Program ini dan tunduk kepada setiap batasan dalam Perjanjian ini. Untuk tujuan Butir "f" ini, "Program Pendukung" adalah Program yang merupakan bagian dari Program IBM lainnya ("Program Utama") dan diidentifikasi sebagai Program Pendukung dalam IL Program Utama. (Untuk mendapatkan lisensi terpisah untuk Program Pendukung tanpa pembatasan-pembatasan ini, Pemegang Lisensi sebaiknya menghubungi pihak yang darinya Pemegang Lisensi telah mendapatkan Program Pendukung.)

Lisensi ini berlaku untuk masing-masing salinan Program yang dibuat oleh Pemegang Lisensi.

3.1 Tukar Tambah, Pembaruan, Perbaikan, dan Tambahan

3.1.1 Tukar Tambah

Apabila Program digantikan oleh Program tukar tambah, lisensi Program yang digantikan segera diakhiri.

3.1.2 Pembaruan, Perbaikan, dan Tambahan

Pada saat Pemegang Lisensi menerima pembaruan, perbaikan atau tambahan untuk Program, Pemegang Lisensi menerima syarat-syarat tambahan atau syarat-syarat yang berbeda yang berlaku untuk pembaruan, perbaikan atau tambahan tersebut yang ditetapkan dalam IL-nya. Apabila syarat-syarat tambahan atau syarat-syarat yang berbeda tidak diberikan, maka pembaruan, perbaikan atau tambahan tersebut semata-mata tunduk kepada Perjanjian ini. Apabila Program digantikan oleh pembaruan, Pemegang Lisensi setuju untuk segera berhenti menggunakan Program yang digantikan.

3.2 Lisensi Jangka Waktu Tertentu

Apabila IBM melisensikan Program selama jangka waktu tertentu, lisensi Pemegang Lisensi diakhiri pada akhir jangka waktu tertentu, kecuali apabila Pemegang Lisensi dan IBM sepakat untuk memperbarui lisensi Program tersebut.

3.3 Jangka Waktu dan Pengakhiran

Perjanjian ini berlaku sampai perjanjian ini diakhiri.

IBM dapat mengakhiri lisensi Pemegang Lisensi apabila Pemegang Lisensi tidak mematuhi syarat-syarat Perjanjian ini.

Apabila lisensi diakhiri karena alasan apa pun oleh salah satu pihak, Pemegang Lisensi setuju untuk segera berhenti menggunakan dan memusnahkan semua salinan Program Pemegang Lisensi. Setiap syarat Perjanjian ini yang berdasarkan sifatnya melampaui pengakhiran Perjanjian ini tetap berlaku sampai syarat tersebut dipenuhi, dan berlaku untuk masing-masing penerus dan penerima pengalihan hak kedua belah pihak.

4. Biaya-biaya

Biaya-biaya, apabila ada, didasarkan pada Penggunaan yang Sah yang telah didapatkan, yang ditetapkan dalam tagihan. IBM tidak memberikan kredit atau pengembalian uang atas biaya-biaya yang telah jatuh tempo atau dibayar, kecuali apabila ditetapkan lain dalam Perjanjian ini.

Apabila Pemegang Lisensi ingin meningkatkan Penggunaannya yang Sah, Pemegang Lisensi harus memberitahukan kepada IBM atau pengecer (reseller) IBM yang sah terlebih dahulu dan membayar setiap biaya yang berlaku.

5. Pajak

Apabila suatu lembaga mengenakan bea, pajak, retribusi atau biaya terhadap Program, tidak termasuk bea, pajak, retribusi atau biaya yang didasarkan pada pendapatan bersih IBM, maka Pemegang Lisensi setuju untuk membayar jumlah tersebut, sebagaimana ditetapkan dalam tagihan atau dokumentasi tentang pembebasan pajak atas pasokan. Pemegang Lisensi bertanggung jawab atas setiap pajak properti pribadi untuk Program sejak tanggal Pemegang Lisensi mendapatkan Program tersebut. Apabila suatu lembaga mengenakan bea cukai, pajak, retribusi atau biaya untuk impor ke dalam atau ekspor, transfer, akses atau penggunaan Program ke luar negeri di mana Pemegang Lisensi awal mendapatkan lisensi, maka Pemegang Lisensi setuju bahwa pihaknya bertanggung jawab atas, dan akan membayar, setiap jumlah yang dikenakan.

6. Jaminan Uang Kembali

Apabila Pemegang Lisensi tidak puas dengan Program karena alasan apa pun dan merupakan Pemegang Lisensi awal, Pemegang Lisensi dapat mengakhiri lisensi dan mendapatkan pengembalian uang atas jumlah yang telah dibayar oleh Pemegang Lisensi, apabila ada, untuk Program, dengan ketentuan bahwa Pemegang Lisensi mengembalikan Program kepada pihak yang darinya Pemegang Lisensi telah mendapatkan Program tersebut dalam jangka waktu 30 hari sejak tanggal tagihan. Apabila lisensi adalah lisensi untuk jangka waktu tertentu yang tunduk kepada pembaruan, maka Pemegang Lisensi dapat mendapatkan pengembalian uang hanya apabila Program dikembalikan dalam jangka waktu 30 hari pertama sejak jangka waktu yang pertama. Apabila Pemegang Lisensi telah mengunduh Program, Pemegang Lisensi sebaiknya menghubungi pihak yang darinya Pemegang Lisensi telah mendapatkan Program tersebut untuk mendapatkan instruksi-instruksi tentang cara untuk mendapatkan pengembalian uang.

7. Transfer Program

Pemegang Lisensi dapat mentransfer Program serta semua hak dan kewajiban lisensi Pemegang Lisensi kepada pihak lainnya hanya apabila pihak tersebut menyetujui syarat-syarat Perjanjian ini. Apabila lisensi diakhiri karena alasan apa pun oleh salah satu pihak, Pemegang Lisensi dilarang untuk mentransfer Program kepada pihak lainnya. Pemegang Lisensi tidak dapat mentransfer sebagian 1) Program atau 2) Penggunaan yang Sah atas Program. Pada saat Pemegang Lisensi mentransfer Program, Pemegang Lisensi juga harus mentransfer salinan kertas Perjanjian ini, termasuk IL. Segera setelah transfer dilakukan, lisensi Pemegang Lisensi berakhir.

8. Tidak Adanya Jaminan

DENGAN TUNDUK KEPADA SETIAP JAMINAN YANG DIDASARKAN PADA UNDANG-UNDANG YANG TIDAK DAPAT DIKECUALIKAN, IBM TIDAK MEMBUAT JAMINAN ATAU KETENTUAN APA PUN, SECARA TEGAS ATAU TERSIRAT, TENTANG PROGRAM ATAU DUKUNGAN, APABILA ADA, TERMASUK, TETAPI TIDAK TERBATAS PADA, SETIAP JAMINAN ATAU KETENTUAN APA PUN SECARA TERSIRAT TENTANG KELAYAKAN UNTUK DIPERJUALBELIKAN, KUALITAS YANG MEMUASKAN, KESESUAIAN UNTUK TUJUAN TERTENTU, DAN HAK MILIK, SERTA SETIAP JAMINAN ATAU KETENTUAN TENTANG TIDAK ADANYA PELANGGARAN. 

BEBERAPA NEGARA ATAU YURISDIKSI TIDAK MEMPERBOLEHKAN PENGECUALIAN TENTANG JAMINAN SECARA TEGAS ATAU TERSIRAT. OLEH KARENA ITU, PENGECUALIAN DI ATAS MUNGKIN TIDAK BERLAKU UNTUK PEMEGANG LISENSI. DALAM HAL TERSEBUT, JAMINAN-JAMINAN TERSEBUT DIBATASI SELAMA PERIODE MINIMUM YANG DIWAJIBKAN OLEH UNDANG-UNDANG. TIDAK ADA JAMINAN APA PUN YANG BERLAKU SETELAH PERIODE TERSEBUT. BEBERAPA NEGARA ATAU YURISDIKSI TIDAK MEMPERBOLEHKAN BATASAN-BATASAN TENTANG BERAPA LAMA JAMINAN YANG TERSIRAT BERLAKU. OLEH KARENA ITU, BATASAN DI ATAS MUNGKIN TIDAK BERLAKU UNTUK PEMEGANG LISENSI. PEMEGANG LISENSI DAPAT MEMILIKI HAK LAINNYA YANG BERBEDA-BEDA ANTARA NEGARA YANG SATU DENGAN NEGARA YANG LAIN ATAU ANTARA YURISDIKSI YANG SATU DENGAN YURISDIKSI YANG LAIN. 

SANGGAHAN-SANGGAHAN DAN PENGECUALIAN-PENGECUALIAN DALAM PASAL 8 INI JUGA BERLAKU UNTUK SETIAP PENGEMBANG DAN PEMASOK PROGRAM IBM. 

PARA PRODUSEN, PEMASOK ATAU PENERBIT PROGRAM NON-IBM DAPAT MEMBERIKAN GARANSI MEREKA SENDIRI.

IBM TIDAK MEMBERIKAN DUKUNGAN DALAM BENTUK APA PUN, KECUALI APABILA IBM MENETAPKAN LAIN. DALAM HAL TERSEBUT, SETIAP DUKUNGAN YANG DIBERIKAN OLEH IBM TUNDUK KEPADA SANGGAHAN-SANGGAHAN DAN PENGECUALIAN-PENGECUALIAN DALAM PASAL 8 INI.

9. Data dan Basis Data Pemegang Lisensi

Untuk membantu Pemegang Lisensi dalam mengisolasi penyebab permasalahan pada Program, IBM dapat meminta agar Pemegang Lisensi 1) memperbolehkan IBM untuk mengakses sistem Pemegang Lisensi dari jarak jauh atau 2) mengirimkan informasi atau data sistem Pemegang Lisensi kepada IBM. Akan tetapi, IBM tidak diwajibkan untuk memberikan asistensi tersebut kecuali apabila IBM dan Pemegang Lisensi mengadakan perjanjian tertulis secara terpisah yang atas dasarnya IBM setuju untuk memberikan kepada Pemegang Lisensi jenis dukungan tersebut, yang tidak termasuk dalam kewajiban-kewajiban IBM dalam Perjanjian ini. Dalam hal apa pun, IBM menggunakan informasi tentang kesalahan-kesalahan dan permasalahan-permasalahan untuk meningkatkan produk dan layanannya serta membantu pemberian tawaran-tawaran dukungan terkait yang dilakukannya. Untuk tujuan-tujuan ini, IBM dapat menggunakan badan-badan dan para subkontraktor IBM (termasuk dalam satu negara atau lebih selain negara di mana Pemegang Lisensi berada), dan Pemegang Lisensi memberikan wewenang kepada IBM untuk melakukan hal tersebut.

Pemegang Lisensi tetap bertanggung jawab atas 1) setiap data dan konten dari setiap basis data yang disediakan oleh Pemegang Lisensi untuk IBM, 2) pilihan dan pelaksanaan prosedur dan kendali yang terkait dengan akses, keamanan, enkripsi, penggunaan, dan transmisi data (termasuk setiap data yang dapat diidentifikasi secara pribadi), serta 3) cadangan dan pemulihan atas setiap basis data dan setiap data yang disimpan. Pemegang Lisensi tidak akan mengirimkan atau memberikan kepada IBM akses ke setiap informasi yang dapat diidentifikasi secara pribadi, dalam bentuk data atau bentuk apa pun lainnya, dan akan bertanggung jawab atas biaya-biaya dan jumlah-jumlah lainnya yang wajar yang mungkin ditanggung oleh IBM terkait dengan setiap informasi tersebut yang secara tidak sengaja diberikan kepada IBM atau kehilangan atau pengungkapan informasi tersebut oleh IBM, termasuk biaya-biaya dan jumlah-jumlah lainnya yang timbul dari tuntutan pihak ketiga.

10. Batasan Kewajiban

Batasan-batasan dan pengecualian-pengecualian dalam Pasal 10 (Batasan Kewajiban) ini berlaku sepanjang batasan-batasan dan pengecualian-pengecualian tersebut tidak dilarang oleh undang-undang yang berlaku tanpa adanya kemungkinan pelepasan kontrak.

10.1 Hal-hal yang Mungkin Menjadi Tanggung Jawab IBM

Keadaan-keadaan dapat timbul apabila, karena wanprestasi dari pihak IBM atau kewajiban lainnya, Pemegang Lisensi berhak untuk mendapatkan ganti rugi dari IBM. Terlepas dari alasan Pemegang Lisensi untuk menuntut ganti rugi dari IBM (termasuk pelanggaran yang mendasar, kelalaian, pernyataan yang salah, atau kontrak lainnya atau tuntutan atas tindakan kejahatan), seluruh kewajiban IBM untuk semua tuntutan secara keseluruhan yang timbul dari atau terkait dengan masing-masing Program atau dengan cara lain, yang timbul berdasarkan Perjanjian ini tidak akan melampaui jumlah dari setiap 1) ganti rugi karena cedera badan (termasuk kematian) dan kerusakan terhadap properti yang bersifat tetap (real property) dan properti pribadi yang berwujud dan 2) ganti rugi aktual atas kerusakan langsung lainnya, sampai sebesar-besarnya biaya yang telah dibayarkan oleh Pemegang Lisensi untuk Program yang menjadi subjek tuntutan (apabila Program tunduk kepada biaya-biaya tetap dalam jangka waktu tertentu, sampai sebesar-besarnya biaya-biaya selama jangka waktu dua belas bulan).

Batas ini juga berlaku untuk setiap pengembang dan pemasok Program IBM. Batas ini merupakan jumlah maksimum tanggung jawab IBM serta para pengembang dan pemasok Programnya secara bersama-sama.

10.2 Hal-hal yang Bukan Merupakan Tanggung Jawab IBM

DALAM SITUASI APA PUN JUGA, IBM, PARA PENGEMBANG ATAU PEMASOK PROGRAMNYA TIDAK BERTANGGUNG JAWAB ATAS SALAH SATU HAL BERIKUT INI, BAHKAN APABILA TELAH DIINFORMASIKAN BAHWA TERDAPAT KEMUNGKINAN TERJADI HAL-HAL BERIKUT INI:

a. KEHILANGAN ATAU KERUSAKAN DATA;

b. KERUSAKAN / KERUGIAN KHUSUS, INSEDENTIL, CONTOH, ATAU KERUSAKAN / KERUGIAN TAK LANGSUNG, ATAU UNTUK SETIAP KERUSAKAN / KERUGIAN SEBAB-AKIBAT EKONOMIS; ATAU

c. HILANGNYA LABA, BISNIS, PENDAPATAN, NAMA BAIK (GOODWILL), ATAU SIMPANAN YANG DIHARAPKAN.

11. Verifikasi terhadap Kepatuhan

Untuk tujuan-tujuan Pasal 11 (Verifikasi terhadap Kepatuhan) ini, "Syarat-syarat Perjanjian Lisensi Internasional untuk Program Tanpa Garansi" ini berarti 1) Perjanjian ini serta perubahan-perubahan dan dokumen-dokumen transaksi yang berlaku yang diberikan oleh IBM, dan 2) kebijakan-kebijakan perangkat lunak IBM yang dapat dilihat di situs web Kebijakan Perangkat Lunak IBM (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), termasuk tetapi tidak terbatas pada kebijakan-kebijakan tersebut yang terkait dengan cadangan, penetapan harga subkapasitas, dan migrasi.

Hak-hak dan kewajiban-kewajiban yang tercantum dalam Pasal 11 ini tetap berlaku selama periode saat Program dilisensikan kepada Pemegang Lisensi dan selama dua tahun berikutnya.

11.1 Proses Verifikasi

Pemegang Lisensi setuju untuk menciptakan, menyimpan, dan memberikan kepada IBM dan para auditornya catatan-catatan tertulis yang akurat, keluaran (output) sistem, dan informasi sistem lainnya yang memadai untuk memberikan verifikasi yang dapat diaudit bahwa penggunaan semua Program oleh Pemegang Lisensi sesuai dengan Syarat-syarat Perjanjian Lisensi Internasional untuk Program Tanpa Garansi, termasuk, tetapi tidak terbatas pada, semua syarat pemberian lisensi dan kualifikasi penetapan harga yang berlaku dari IBM. Pemegang Lisensi bertanggung jawab untuk 1) memastikan bahwa pihaknya tidak melampaui Penggunaannya yang Sah dan 2) tetap sesuai dengan Syarat-syarat Perjanjian Lisensi Internasional untuk Program Tanpa Garansi.

Setelah adanya pemberitahuan yang wajar, IBM dapat memverifikasi kepatuhan Pemegang Lisensi terhadap Syarat-syarat Perjanjian Lisensi Internasional untuk Program Tanpa Garansi di semua lokasi dan untuk semua lingkungan di mana Pemegang Lisensi menggunakan (untuk tujuan apa pun) Program-program dengan tunduk kepada Syarat-syarat Perjanjian Lisensi Internasional untuk Program Tanpa Garansi. Verifikasi tersebut akan dilakukan dengan cara yang seminimal mungkin mengganggu bisnis Pemegang Lisensi, dan dapat dilakukan di tempat-tempat Pemegang Lisensi, selama jam-jam kerja normal. IBM dapat menggunakan auditor yang independen untuk membantu verifikasi tersebut, dengan ketentuan bahwa IBM memiliki perjanjian kerahasiaan tertulis yang ada pada auditor tersebut.

11.2 Resolusi

IBM akan memberitahukan kepada Pemegang Lisensi secara tertulis apabila verifikasi tersebut menunjukkan bahwa Pemegang Lisensi telah menggunakan Program dengan cara yang melampaui Penggunaannya yang Sah atau dengan cara lain, tidak sesuai dengan Syarat-syarat Perjanjian Lisensi Internasional untuk Program Tanpa Garansi. Pemegang Lisensi setuju untuk segera membayar kepada IBM secara langsung biaya-biaya yang ditetapkan oleh IBM dalam tagihan untuk 1) setiap kelebihan penggunaan tersebut, 2) dukungan untuk kelebihan penggunaan tersebut selama kurang dari jangka waktu kelebihan penggunaan tersebut atau dua tahun, dan 3) setiap biaya tambahan dan kewajiban lainnya yang ditentukan yang diakibatkan oleh verifikasi tersebut.

12. Pemberitahuan Pihak Ketiga

Program dapat termasuk kode pihak ketiga yang dilisensikan oleh IBM, bukan pihak ketiga, kepada Pemegang Lisensi berdasarkan Perjanjian ini. Pemberitahuan-pemberitahuan, apabila ada, untuk kode pihak ketiga ("Pemberitahuan Pihak Ketiga") dimasukkan hanya untuk informasi Pemegang Lisensi. Pemberitahuan-pemberitahuan ini dapat dilihat di dalam berkas(-berkas) PEMBERITAHUAN Program. Informasi tentang cara untuk mendapatkan sumber kode untuk kode pihak ketiga tertentu dapat dilihat di dalam Pemberitahuan Pihak Ketiga. Apabila di dalam Pemberitahuan Pihak Ketiga, IBM mengidentifikasi kode pihak ketiga sebagai "Kode Pihak Ketiga yang Dapat Dimodifikasi", IBM memberikan wewenang kepada Pemegang Lisensi untuk 1) memodifikasi Kode Pihak Ketiga yang Dapat Dimodifikasi dan 2) merekayasa kembali modul-modul Program yang terhubung secara langsung dengan Kode Pihak Ketiga yang Dapat Dimodifikasi dengan ketentuan bahwa modul-modul tersebut hanya untuk tujuan debug modifikasi-modifikasi Pemegang Lisensi atas kode pihak ketiga tersebut. Kewajiban-kewajiban layanan dan dukungan IBM, apabila ada, berlaku hanya untuk Program yang tidak dimodifikasi.

Le condizioni incluse nella Parte 2 possono sostituire o modificare quelle contenute nella Parte 1. In caso di conflitto, la LI prevarrà su entrambe le Parti.

3. Concessione della Licenza

Il Programma è di proprietà di IBM o di un fornitore IBM, ed è tutelato dalle leggi sul diritto di autore, viene concesso in licenza, ma non viene venduto.

IBM concede al Licenziatario una licenza non esclusiva per 1) utilizzare il Programma fino al livello di utilizzo specificato nella fattura, 2) effettuare ed installare copie per supportare tale utilizzo e 3) effettuare una copia di backup, tutto a condizione che

a. il Licenziatario abbia legalmente ottenuto il Programma e soddisfi le clausole di questo Accordo;

b. la copia di backup non funzioni a meno che il Programma di cui è eseguito il backup non possa funzionare;

c. Il Licenziatario riproduca su ciascuna copia, anche parziale, del Programma le indicazioni relative al diritto d'autore e ogni altra indicazione relativa a diritti di proprietà;

d. il Licenziatario si assicuri che chiunque utilizzi il Programma (con accesso locale o remoto) 1) rispetti l'uso autorizzato e 2) rispetti le clausole di questo Accordo;

e. Il Licenziatario non 1) utilizzi, copi o distribuisca il Programma fatto salvo quanto previsto nel presente Accordo; 2) assembli a ritroso, compili a ritroso, o in altro modo traduca o esegua il reverse engineering del Programma, salvo quanto espressamente consentito dalle norme inderogabili di legge, senza possibilità di deroga contrattuale,; 3) utilizzi alcuna delle componenti del Programma, dei file, dei moduli, del contenuto audio-visivo, o di materiale correlato concesso in licenza separatamente dal Programma; o 4) sublicenzi, conceda in noleggio o locazione il Programma; e

f. se il Licenziatario ottiene questo Programma come Programma di supporto, utilizzi questo Programma solo per supportare il Programma Principale e sia soggetto a qualsiasi limitazione nella licenza per il Programma Principale, o, se il Licenziatario ottiene questo Programma come Programma Principale, utilizzi tutti i Programmi di Supporto solo per supportare questo Programma, e sia soggetto a tutte le limitazioni in questo Accordo. Ai fini di questo punto "f," per "Programma di Supporto" si intende un Programma che è parte di un altro Programma IBM ("Programma Principale") e identificato come Programma di Supporto nella LI del Programma Principale. (Per ottenere una licenza a parte ad un Programma di Supporto senza tali limitazioni, il Licenziatario dovrà contattare la parte da cui ha ottenuto il Programma di Supporto).

Questa licenza si applica ad ogni copia del Programma effettuata dal Licenziatario.

3.1 Trade-up, Aggiornamenti, Correzione (Fix) e Patch

3.1.1 Trade-up

Se il Programma è sostituito da un Programma di trade-up, la licenza del Programma sostituito terminerà immediatamente.

3.1.2 Aggiornamenti, Correzione (Fix) e Patch

Quando il Licenziatario riceve un aggiornamento, correzione, o patch ad un Programma, accetta qualsiasi clausola aggiuntiva o differente applicabile a tale aggiornamento, correzione o patch specificata nella sua LI. Se non sono fornite clausole aggiuntive o differenti, allora gli aggiornamenti, correzioni o patch sono soggetti solo a questo Accordo. Se il Programma è sostituito da un aggiornamento, il Licenziatario accetta di sospendere subito l'uso del Programma sostituito.

3.2 Licenze con durata fissa

Se IBM concede in licenza il Programma per una durata fissa, la licenza del Licenziatario cesserà alla fine della durata fissa, a meno che il Licenziatario e IBM non accettino di rinnovarla.

IBM potrà revocare la licenza del Licenziatario qualora questi non rispetti le clausole del presente Accordo.

In caso di revoca della licenza da entrambe le parti, per qualsiasi motivo, il Licenziatario accetta di sospendere subito l'uso e distruggere tutte le copie del Programma effettuate. Qualsiasi clausola del presente Accordo che per sua natura si estende oltre la cessazione dell'Accordo, resterà in vigore fino al suo adempimento e si applicherà ai rispettivi successori e agli assegnatari delle parti.

4. Canoni

I canoni, se previsti, si basano sull'Uso Autorizzato ottenuto, specificato nella fattura. IBM non rilascia crediti o rimborsi per somme già dovute o pagate, salvo se diversamente specificato in questo Accordo.

Se il Licenziatario desidera aumentare il proprio Uso Autorizzato, dovrà comunicarlo in anticipo ad IBM o ad un rivenditore autorizzato IBM e pagare tutti i corrispettivi applicabili.

5. Tasse

Qualora qualsiasi autorità imponga sul Programma una tassa, un'imposta, un dazio, o un canone, con l'esclusione di quelli basati sul reddito imponibile di IBM, allora il Licenziatario accetta di pagare l'ammontare o si dovrà fornire documentazione dell'esenzione eventualmente spettante. Il Licenziatario è responsabile di qualsiasi tassa relativa alla proprietà personale sul Programma dalla data del suo acquisto. Qualora un'autorità imponga un dazio doganale, una tassa, un'imposta o un canone per l'importazione, l'esportazione, il trasferimento, l'accesso o l'utilizzo del Programma al di fuori del paese in cui il Licenziatario originario ha ottenuto la licenza, allora il Licenziatario accetta di essere responsabile per qualsiasi somma imposta e di pagarla.

6. Garanzia di rimborso

Qualora il Licenziatario non sia soddisfatto del Programma per qualsiasi ragione e sia anche il Licenziatario originale, potrà ottenere un rimborso del corrispettivo pagato per il Programma, se previsto, a condizione che il Licenziatario restituisca il Programma alla parte da cui lo ha acquistato entro 30 giorni dalla data della fattura. Se la licenza è concessa per una durata fissa soggetta a rinnovo, allora il Licenziatario potrà ottenere un rimborso solo se il Programma sarà restituito entro 30 giorni dalla data iniziale. Se il Licenziatario ha scaricato il Programma, dovrà contattare la parte da cui lo ha ottenuto per istruzioni su come ottenere il rimborso.

7. Trasferimento del Programma

Il Licenziatario può trasferire il Programma e tutti i suoi obblighi e diritti di licenza a terze parti solo se tale parte accetta le clausole del presente Accordo.

8. Esclusioni delle garanzie

FATTE SALVE LE GARANZIE INDEROGABILI DI LEGGE, IBM NON FORNISCE GARANZIE O CONDIZIONI, ESPRESSE O IMPLICITE, RELATIVE AL PROGRAMMA O AL SUPPORTO, SE ESISTENTE, INCLUSE, MA NON LIMITATE A, GARANZIE O CONDIZIONI IMPLICITE DI COMMERCIABILITA', DI QUALITA', IDONEITA' PER UNO SCOPO PARTICOLARE, E TITOLARITA', E NON VIOLAZIONE.

POICHÉ LA LEGISLAZIONE DI ALCUNI PAESI NON CONSENTE L'ESCLUSIONE DELLE GARANZIE ESPRESSE O IMPLICITE, LA SUDDETTA ESCLUSIONE POTREBBE NON ESSERE APPLICABILE. IN TAL CASO, TALI GARANZIE SARANNO LIMITATE ALLA DURATA DEL PERIODO MINIMO PREVISTO DALLA LEGGE. NESSUNA GARANZIA E' APPLICABILE DOPO TALE PERIODO. POICHÉ LA LEGISLAZIONE DI ALCUNI PAESI NON CONSENTE LIMITAZIONI BASATE SULLA DURATA DI UNA GARANZIA IMPLICITA, LA SUDDETTA LIMITAZIONE POTREBBE NON ESSERE APPLICABILE. IL LICENZIATARIO PUO' OTTENERE ULTERIORI DIRITTI DERIVANTI DALLA LEGISLAZIONE SPECIFICA DI CIASCUN PAESE.

RINUNCE ED ESCLUSIONI IN QUESTA SEZIONE 8 SI APPLICANO ANCHE AGLI SVILUPPATORI E FORNITORI DEL PROGRAMMA IBM.

I PRODUTTORI, I FORNITORI O GLI EDITORI DI PROGRAMMI NON IBM POSSONO FORNIRE GARANZIE PROPRIE.

IBM NON FORNISCE SUPPORTO DI ALCUN TIPO, SE NON DIVERSAMENTE SPECIFICATO. IN TAL CASO, QUALSIASI SUPPORTO FORNITO DA IBM E' SOGGETTO ALLE RINUNCE ED ESCLUSIONI IN QUESTA SEZIONE 8.

9. Dati e Database del Licenziatario

Per assistere il Licenziatario nell'isolare la causa di un problema con il Programma, IBM può richiedere che il Licenziatario 1) consenta ad IBM di accedere in remoto al sistema del Licenziatario o 2) invii le informazioni del Licenziatario o i dati del sistema a IBM. Tuttavia, IBM non è obbligata a fornire tale assistenza a meno che IBM ed il Licenziatario non abbiano stipulato un accordo scritto a parte in base al quale IBM accetta di fornire al Licenziatario quel tipo di supporto che va oltre gli obblighi di IBM in questo Accordo. In ogni caso, IBM utilizzerà le informazioni sugli errori e i problemi per migliorare i suoi prodotti e servizi ed assistere il Licenziatario con la fornitura di offerte di supporto correlate. A tal fine, IBM può utilizzare enti o subappaltatori di IBM (anche in uno o più paesi diversi da quello in cui ha sede il Licenziatario), ed il Licenziatario autorizza IBM a procedere in tal senso.

Il Licenziatario resta responsabile per 1) i dati ed il contenuto di qualsiasi database che il Licenziatario rende disponibile ad IBM, 2) la scelta e l'implementazione di procedure e controlli relativi all'accesso, alla sicurezza, alla crittografia, all'uso e alla trasmissione di dati (inclusi dati personali), e 3) il backup e il recupero di database e dati memorizzati. Il Licenziatario non invierà o fornirà ad IBM accesso ad informazioni personali, sotto forma di dati o in altri formati, e sarà responsabile dei costi ragionevoli e di qualsiasi altra somma che IBM si trovi ad affrontare relativa alle informazioni erroneamente fornite ad IBM o alla perdita o divulgazione di tali informazioni da parte di IBM, incluse quelle derivanti da pretese di risarcimento di terze parti.

10. Limitazione di Responsabilità

Le limitazioni ed esclusioni in questa Sezione 10 (Limitazione di Responsabilità) si applicano nei limiti in cui non sono vietate dalla legislazione applicabile senza possibilità di deroga contrattuale.

10.1 Casi nei quali è prevista una responsabilità da parte IBM

Possono verificarsi circostanze in cui, per fatto imputabile ad IBM o per responsabilità di terzi, il Licenziatario abbia il diritto ad un risarcimento da parte di IBM. In questi casi, indipendentemente da ciò che dà titolo al Licenziatario a richiedere il risarcimento danni ad IBM (inclusi colpa grave, negligenza, erronee dichiarazioni o altri fatti di natura contrattuale o extracontrattuale), la responsabilità di IBM è limitata 1) ai danni fisici alla persona (incluso il decesso), ai beni immobili e mobili appartenenti alle persone fisiche per i quali IBM sia responsabile per legge e 2) nel caso di ogni altro danno diretto fino al corrispettivo pagato per il Programma oggetto della richiesta del risarcimento.

Questo limite si applica anche a qualsiasi sviluppatore e fornitore dei Programmi IBM. Ciò rappresenta il limite massimo per cui IBM e i suoi sviluppatori e fornitori del Programma sono collettivamente responsabili.

10.2 Casi nei quali è esclusa una responsabilità da parte IBM

IN NESSUN CASO IBM, GLI SVILUPPATORI DEL PROGRAMMA O I FORNITORI SARANNO RESPONSABILI PER QUANTO SEGUE, ANCHE SE INFORMATI DELLA POSSIBILITÀ DEL LORO VERIFICARSI:

a. PERDITA O DANNEGGIAMENTO DI DATI;

b. DANNI SPECIALI, INCIDENTALI, ESEMPLARI, O INDIRETTI, O QUALSIASI ALTRO DANNO ECONOMICO CONSEGUENTE; O

c. MANCATI GUADAGNI, PERDITA DI OPPORTUNITÀ COMMERCIALE, DI REDDITO, DI BENEFICI, O MANCATI RISPARMI.

11. Verifica della conformità

Ai fini di questa Sezione 11 (Verifica della Conformità), per "Clausole del Programma ILAN" si intende 1) il presente Accordo e gli emendamenti applicabili e i documenti della transazione forniti da IBM, e 2) le politiche software IBM che si possono trovare sul sito web IBM Software Policy (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), incluse ad esempio quelle politiche relative al backup, alla determinazione dei prezzi per sub-capacity, e alla migrazione.

I diritti e gli obblighi stabiliti in questa Sezione 11 resteranno in vigore per il periodo in cui il Programma è concesso in licenza al Licenziatario e per i due anni successivi.

11.1 Processo di Verifica

Il licenziatario accetta di creare, conservare e fornire ad IBM e ai suoi revisori accurate registrazioni scritte, esito delle analisi svolte mediante strumenti di sistema e altre informazioni relative al sistema sufficienti a fornire una verifica che dimostri che l'uso del Licenziatario di tutti i Programmi è conforme alle Condizioni del Programma ILAN, incluse, ad esempio, tutte le condizioni di licenza d'uso IBM applicabili e le condizioni di eleggibilità e di definizione dei prezzi. Il Licenziatario è responsabile 1) di garantire che non supererà il suo Uso Autorizzato, e 2) di restare conforme alle Clausole del Programma ILAN.

Con ragionevole preavviso, IBM può verificare la conformità con le Condizioni del Programma ILAN del Licenziatario presso tutte le sedi e per tutti gli ambienti in cui il Licenziatario utilizza (per qualsiasi scopo) i Programmi in base alle Clausole del Programma ILAN. Tale verifica sarà condotta in modo da arrecare il minor intralcio possibile alle attività commerciali del Licenziatario, e potrà essere condotta presso la sede del Licenziatario, durante il normale orario lavorativo. IBM può utilizzare un revisore esterno in tale verifica, a condizione che IBM abbia sottoscritto con tale revisore un accordo di riservatezza ancora in vigore.

11.2 Risoluzione

Qualora IBM dovesse riscontrare che il Licenziatario ha utilizzato il Programma oltre il suo Uso Autorizzato o in modo non conforme alle Condizioni del Programma ILAN, lo comunicherà al Licenziatario per iscritto. Il Licenziatario accetta di pagare prontamente e direttamente ad IBM il corrispettivo specificato da IBM in una fattura per 1) qualsiasi uso che ecceda quello autorizzato, 2) il supporto di tale uso per un periodo minore alla durata di tale uso in eccesso o per due anni, e 3) qualsiasi corrispettivo aggiuntivo e altra responsabilità determinata a seguito di tale verifica.

Avvisi di Terze Parti

Il Programma può includere codice di terze parti che IBM, non la terza parte, concede in licenza al Licenziatario in base al presente Accordo. Gli avvisi per il codice di terze parti, se esistenti, ("Avvisi di Terze Parti") sono inclusi solo per informazioni del Licenziatario. E' possibile trovare tali avvisi nei file NOTICES del Programma. Le informazioni su come ottenere il codice sorgente per determinato codice di terze parti si possono trovare negli Avvisi delle Terze Parti. Se negli Avvisi delle Terze Parti IBM dovesse identificare codice di terze parti come "Codice di Terze Parti Modificabile", IBM autorizza il Licenziatario a 1) modificare il Codice di Terze Parti Modificabile e 2) eseguire il reverse engineer dei moduli del Programma che si interfacciano direttamente con il Codice di Terze Parti Modificabile a condizione che sia solo allo scopo di eseguire il debug delle modifiche del Licenziatario per tale codice di terze parti. Le obbligazioni IBM relative a servizi e supporto, ove applicabili, si applicano esclusivamente al Programma non modificato.

13. Disposizioni Generali

a. Le disposizioni del presente Accordo non pregiudicano in alcun modo i diritti e le garanzie di legge del consumatore che non possono essere escluse o limitate per contratto.

b. Per i Programmi che IBM fornisce al Licenziatario in formato tangibile, IBM adempirà ai propri obblighi di distribuzione e consegna alla consegna di tali Programmi al corriere designato da IBM, salvo quanto diversamente concordato per iscritto tra il Licenziatario ed IBM.

c. Qualora una qualsiasi clausola del presente Accordo dovesse essere dichiarata invalida o inefficace, le restanti clausole del presente Accordo rimarranno pienamente in vigore ed efficaci.

d. Il Licenziatario accetta di rispettare tutte le disposizioni di legge e le normative applicabili in materia di importazione ed esportazione, incluse le norme sull'embargo degli Stati Uniti e le sanzioni e divieti sull'esportazione per determinati utilizzi o determinati utenti.

e. Il Licenziatario autorizza International Business Machines Corporation e le sue consociate (e i loro successori e assegnatari, appaltatori e Business Partner IBM) di memorizzare e utilizzare le informazioni relative a contatti, laddove vi siano rapporti commerciali, ovunque essi operino, insieme ai prodotti e servizi IBM, per usi relativi alle attività commerciali tra IBM e il Licenziatario.

f. Ciascuna parte consente all'altra l'opportunità ragionevole di conformarsi prima che questa reclami la mancata conformità ai suoi obblighi in base al presente Accordo. Le parti tenteranno in buona fede di risolvere tutte le dispute, le controversie o i reclami relativi al presente Accordo.

g. Salvo quanto diversamente richiesto dalla legge applicabile, senza possibilità di rinuncia contrattuale o limitazione: 1) nessuna parte intraprenderà un'azione legale, indipendentemente dalla forma, per qualsiasi reclamo derivante da o relativo al presente Accordo per oltre due anni a far data dalla causa che ha dato vita all'azione; e 2) alla scadenza di tale limite, qualsiasi pretesa e diritto rispettivo relativo al reclamo decadono.

h. Né il Licenziatario né IBM saranno ritenuti responsabili per eventuali inadempimenti dovuti a cause che esulano dal proprio controllo.

i. Il presente Accordo non creerà alcun diritto o azione legale da terze parti, né IBM sarà responsabile di alcun reclamo da parte di terzi, fatto salvo quanto consentito nella suddetta Sottosezione 10.1 (Casi nei quali è prevista una responsabilità da parte IBM ) per danni fisici alla persona (incluso il decesso) o danni ai beni immobili e mobili appartenenti alle persone fisiche per i quali IBM sia responsabile per legge.

j. Mediante la sottoscrizione del presente Accordo, nessuna delle parti farà affidamento su eventuali dichiarazioni non specificate in questo Accordo, incluse, a titolo esemplificativo ma non esaustivo, dichiarazioni relative: 1) a prestazioni o funzionamento del Programma; 2) alle esperienze o a raccomandazioni di altre parti; o 3) a risultati o risparmi che il Licenziatario possa raggiungere.

k. IBM ha stipulato accordi con determinate organizzazioni (chiamate "Business Partner IBM") per promuovere, commercializzare, e fornire assistenza per determinati Programmi. I Business Partner IBM restano soggetti indipendenti e separati da IBM. IBM non è responsabile per le azioni o le dichiarazioni dei Business Partner IBM né delle obbligazioni che essi abbiano assunto nei confronti del Licenziatario.

l. Le condizioni di licenza e di indennizzo per la proprietà intellettuale di altri accordi del Licenziatario con IBM (come l'IBM Customer Agreement) non si applicano alle licenze del Programma concesse in base al presente Accordo.

m. Entrambe le parti accettano che tutte le informazioni scambiate saranno considerate non riservate. Nel caso in cui una parte richieda lo scambio di informazioni riservate, ciò avverrà previa sottoscrizione di un accordo di riservatezza;

14. Ambito geografico e Legge Applicabile

JEIGU NESUTINKATE SU ŠIOMIS SĄLYGOMIS,

* NESIŲSKITE, NEDIEKITE, NEKOPIJUOKITE, NEBANDYKITE PASIEKTI PROGRAMOS, NESPAUSKITE MYGTUKO „SUTINKU“ AR NESINAUDOKITE PROGRAMA; IR

* NEDELSDAMI GRĄŽINKITE NENAUDOTAS LAIKMENAS IR DOKUMENTACIJĄ ŠALIAI, IŠ KURIOS JUOS GAVOTE, KAD SUSIGRĄŽINTUMĖTE UŽ PROGRAMĄ SUMOKĖTUS PINIGUS. JEI PROGRAMA BUVO ATSISIŲSTA, SUNAIKINKITE VISAS PROGRAMOS KOPIJAS.

1. Apibrėžimai

„Įgaliotasis naudojimas“ - numatytas lygis, apibrėžiantis, kaip Licenciatas įgaliotas paleisti ir vykdyti Programą. Šis lygis gali būti nustatomas pagal naudotojų skaičių, paslaugų vienetų milijonus (MPV), procesoriaus vertės vienetus (PVV) arba kitus naudojimo lygius, kuriuos nurodo IBM.

IBM - „International Business Machines Corporation“ arba vienas iš jos filialų.

„Licencijos informacija“ (LI) - dokumentas, kuriame pateikta specifinė informacija apie Programą ir papildomos sąlygos. Programos LI galima rasti internete adresu www.ibm.com/software/sla. LI taip pat galima rasti Programos kataloge, naudojant sisteminę komandą, arba lankstinuke, kuris pridėtas prie Programos.

„Programa“ - šie išvardyti dalykai, jų originalai ir visos išsamios arba dalinės kopijos: 1) kompiuterio skaitomos instrukcijos ir duomenys, 2) komponentai, failai ir moduliai, 3) garsinė ir vaizdinė medžiaga (pvz., vaizdai, tekstas, įrašai ar paveikslėliai), ir 4) susijusi licencijos medžiaga (tokia, kaip raktai ir dokumentacija).

2. Sutarties struktūra

Šią sutartį sudaro: 1 dalis - bendrosios sąlygos, 2 dalis - konkrečiai šaliai taikomos sąlygos (jei tokių yra) ir LI. Tai yra galutinis susitarimas tarp Licenciato ir IBM dėl naudojimosi Programa. Ji pakeičia bet kokį ankstesnį žodinį ar raštinį bendravimą tarp Licenciato ir IBM, kurių metu buvo aptariamas Licenciato naudojimasis Programa. 2 dalies sąlygos gali pakeisti 1 dalies sąlygas. Atsiradus bet kokiems prieštaravimams, bus remiamasi LI.

3. Licencijos suteikiamos teisės

Programa yra IBM arba IBM platintojo nuosavybė, ginama autoriaus teisių, naudojimuisi ja suteikiama licencija, bet ji nėra parduodama.

IBM suteikia Licenciatui neišimtinę licenciją 1) naudotis Programa pagal Įgaliotojo naudojimo sąlygas, nurodytas sąskaitoje, 2) kurti ir diegti kopijas, kurios palaikytų Įgaliotąjį naudojimą, ir 3) kurti atsarginę kopiją su sąlyga, kad

a. Licenciatas teisėtai įsigijo Programą ir laikosi šios Sutarties sąlygų;

b. atsarginė kopija nepaleidžiama, nebent neveikia pati Programa, kurios atsarginė kopija sukurta;

c. Licenciatas ant kiekvienos Programos išsamios ar dalinės kopijos nurodo visą autoriaus teisių informaciją bei kitus nuosavybės ženklus;

d. Licenciatas užtikrina, kad kiekvienas, kuris naudojasi Programa (vietine ar nuotoline prieiga) 1) naudojasi tik Licenciato vardu ir 2) laikosi šios Sutarties sąlygų;

e. Licenciatas 1) nenaudoja, nekopijuoja, nekeičia ir neplatina Programos, nebent tai aiškiai leidžiama šioje Sutartyje; 2) nebando išardyti, dekompiliuoti, versti ar atkurti Programos kodo, nebent tai aiškiai leidžia įstatymai ir nesuteikiama teisė atsisakyti sutartyse; 3) nenaudoja jokių Programos komponentų, failų, modulių, garsinio ir vaizdinio turinio ar susijusios licencijuotos medžiagos atskirai nuo Programos; ir 4) neišduoda licencijos trečiajai šaliai, nenuomoja ir išperkamosios nuomos pagrindais nesuteikia Programos; ir

f. jei Licenciatas įgyja šią Programą kaip Pagalbinę programą, Licenciatas naudoja šią Programą tik kaip pagalbinę priemonę, palaikančią Pagrindinę programą, jai taikomi bet kokie Pagrindinės programos licencijos apribojimai, arba, jei Licenciatas įgyja šią programą kaip Pagrindinę programą, Licenciatas naudoja visas Pagalbines programas tik šiai Programai palaikyti, jai taikomi bet kokie šios Sutarties apribojimai. Šiame punkte „f“ „Pagalbinė programa“ yra Programa, kuri yra kitos IBM Programos („Pagrindinės programos“) dalis ir kuri Pagrindinės programos LI yra nurodoma kaip Pagalbinė programa. (Norėdamas gauti atskirą Pagalbinės programos licenciją be šių apribojimų, Licenciatas turėtų susisiekti šalimi, iš kurios įsigijo Pagalbinę programą.)

Ši licencija taikoma kiekvienai Licenciato padarytai Programos kopijai.

3.1 Pakeitimai, atnaujinimai, pataisos ir taisymai

3.1.1 Pakeitimai

Jei Programa pakeičiama kita Programa, pakeistos Programos licencija yra nedelsiant nutraukiama.

3.1.2 Atnaujinimai, pataisos ir taisymai

Kai Licenciatas gauna Programos atnaujinimą, pataisą ar pataisymą, Licenciatas sutinka su bet kokiomis papildomomis ar skirtingomis sąlygomis, taikomomis šiems atnaujinimas, pataisoms ar pataisymams, kurios yra nurodytos LI. Jei nepateikta jokių papildomų ar pakeistų sąlygų, tuomet atnaujinimui, pataisai ar pataisymui taikomos tik šios Sutarties sąlygos. Jei Programa pakeičiama atnaujinimu, Licenciatas sutinka nedelsdamas nutraukti pakeistos Programos naudojimą.

3.2 Fiksuotos trukmės licencijos

Jei IBM suteikia Programai ribotojo laikotarpio licenciją, Licenciato licencija baigia galioti, pasibaigus fiksuotam laikotarpiui, nebent Licenciatas ir IBM susitaria ją atnaujinti.

3.3 Terminas ir nutraukimas

Ši sutartis galioja tol, kol yra nutraukiama.

IBM gali nutraukti Licenciato licenciją, jei Licenciatas nesilaiko Sutarties sąlygų.

Jei licencija yra nutraukiama bet kurios šalies iniciatyva dėl bet kokios priežasties, Licenciatas sutinka nedelsdamas nutraukti Programos naudojimą ir sunaikinti visas turimas Programos kopijas. Jei tam tikros Sutarties sąlygos dėl savo pobūdžio išlieka galioti po Sutarties nutraukimo, jos galioja, kol bus įvykdytos, ir taikomos abiejų šalių atitinkamiems teisių perėmėjams ir įgaliotiniams.

4. Mokėjimas

Mokesčiai priklauso nuo Įgaliotojo naudojimo pobūdžio, kuris yra aprašytas sąskaitoje. IBM neteikia kreditų, jei vėluojama sumokėti, ir negrąžina jau sumokėtų pinigų, išskyrus atvejus, aprašytus Sutartyje.

Jei Licenciatas nori išplėsti savo Įgaliotojo naudojimo ribas, Licenciatas turi iš anksto pranešti IBM arba įgaliotajam IBM atstovui ir apmokėti visas susijusias išlaidas.

5. Mokesčiai

Jeigu kuri nors valdžios institucija taiko Programai muitą, mokesčius ar kitokią rinkliavą, išskyrus tuos, kurie skaičiuojami nuo IBM grynojo pelno, Licenciatas sutinka sumokėti sąskaitoje faktūroje nurodytą sumą arba pateikti atleidimo nuo mokesčių dokumentus. Nuo Programos įsigijimo dienos Licenciatas yra atsakingas už bet kokius Programos nuosavybės mokesčius. Jeigu kuri nors valdžios institucija taiko muitą, mokesčius ar kitokią rinkliavą už Programos importą, eksportą, persiuntimą, prieigą ar naudojimą už valstybės, kurioje Licenciatui suteikta licencija, ribų, Licenciatas sutinka sumokėti paskirtą sumą.

6. Pinigų grąžinimo garantijos

Jei pradinis Licenciatas dėl kokių nors priežasčių yra nepatenkintas Programa, Licenciatas gali per 30 dienų nuo sąskaitos išrašymo datos nutraukti licenciją ir susigrąžinti pinigus, kuriuos mokėjo už Programą, su sąlyga, kad Licenciatas grąžina Programą tai šaliai, iš kurios ją įsigijo. Jei suteikta ribotojo laikotarpio licencija, kurią galima pratęsti, Licenciatas gali susigrąžinti pinigus tik tuo atveju, jei Programa sugrąžinta per pirmąsias 30 pirmojo termino dienų. Jeigu Licenciatas Programą atsisiuntė, jis turi susisiekti su ją išdavusia šalimi ir iš jos gauti pinigų susigrąžinimo instrukcijas.

7. Programos perleidimas

Licenciatas gali perleisti Programą bei visas savo licencines teises ir įsipareigojimus kitai šaliai tik tuo atveju, jei ta šalis sutinka su šios Sutarties sąlygomis. Jei kuri nors šalis dėl tam tikrų priežasčių licenciją nutraukia, Licenciatas nebegali perleisti Programos trečiajai šaliai. Licenciatas negali perleisti dalies 1) Programos ar 2) Programos Įgaliotojo naudojimo. Perleisdamas Programą, Licenciatas kartu su LI taip pat privalo perleisti spausdintą šios Sutarties kopiją. Iš karto po perleidimo Licenciato licencija yra nutraukiama.

8. Garantijų atsisakymas

PAGAL ĮSTATYMO NUSTATYTAS GARANTIJAS, KURIŲ NEGALIMA NEĮTRAUKTI, „IBM“ NESUTEIKIA JOKIŲ SU PROGRAMA AR PALAIKYMO PASLAUGOMIS (JEI TOKIOS TEIKIAMOS) SUSIJUSIŲ AIŠKIAI NURODYTŲ AR NENURODYTŲ GARANTIJŲ ARBA SĄLYGŲ, ĮSKAITANT, BET NEAPSIRIBOJANT, NENURODYTAS TINKAMUMO PREKIAUTI, TINKAMUMO TAM TIKRAM TIKSLUI, NUOSAVYBĖS TEISĖS IR BET KOKIAS NEPAŽEIDŽIAMUMO GARANTIJAS ARBA SĄLYGAS.

KAI KURIOSE VALSTYBĖSE ARBA JURISDIKCIJOSE NELEIDŽIAMOS AIŠKIAI NURODYTŲ AR NENURODYTŲ GARANTIJŲ IŠIMTYS, TODĖL ČIA NURODYTA IŠIMTIS LICENCIATUI GALI BŪTI NETAIKOMA. TOKIU ATVEJU ŠIŲ GARANTIJŲ TAIKYMAS APRIBOJAMAS MINIMALIA TEISĖS AKTUOSE NUMATYTA TRUKME. ŠIAM LAIKOTARPIUI PRAĖJUS NEBETAIKOMOS JOKIOS GARANTIJOS. KAI KURIOSE VALSTYBĖSE AR JURISDIKCIJOSE NELEIDŽIAMA RIBOTI NUMANOMOS GARANTIJOS TRUKMĖS, TODĖL AUKŠČIAU PATEIKTI APRIBOJIMAI LICENCIATUI GALI BŪTI NETAIKOMI.LICENCIATAS TAIP PAT GALI TURĖTI KITŲ TEISIŲ, KURIOS SKIRSIS PRIKLAUSOMAI NUO VALSTYBĖS ARBA JURISDIKCIJOS.

8 SKYRIUJE NURODYTI PANEIGIMAI IR IŠIMTYS TAIP PAT TAIKOMI VISIEMS „IBM“ PROGRAMŲ KŪRĖJAMS IR TIEKĖJAMS.

NE „IBM“ PROGRAMŲ GAMINTOJAI, TIEKĖJAI ARBA LEIDĖJAI GALI TEIKTI SAVO GARANTIJAS.

„IBM“ NETEIKIA JOKIO PALAIKYMO, JEI „IBM“ NENURODO KITAIP. TOKIU ATVEJU, BET KOKIAM „IBM“ SUTEIKTAM PALAIKYMUI TAIKOMOS 8 SKYRIUJE NURODYTŲ PANEIGIMŲ IR IŠIMČIŲ SĄLYGOS.

9. Licenciato duomenys ir duomenų bazės

Siekdama padėti Licenciatui išspręsti su Programa susijusias problemas, IBM gali paprašyti, kad Licenciatas 1) leistų IBM nuotoliniu būdu prisijungti prie Licenciato sistemos arba 2) atsiųstų savo informaciją ar sistemos duomenis į IBM. Tačiau IBM neprivalo teikti tokios pagalbos, nebent IBM ir Licenciatas pasirašo atskirą susitarimą, kuriame IBM sutinka teikti Licenciatui tokio pobūdžio palaikymą, kuris nėra numatytas šios Sutarties IBM įsipareigojimuose. Bet kokiu atveju IBM naudoja informaciją apie klaidas ir problemas savo produktams ir paslaugoms tobulinti ir techninei pagalbai teikti. Licenciatas sutinka su tokia IBM, IBM juridinių asmenų ir subrangovų (veikiančių ne tik Licenciato valstybėje) veikla.

Licenciatas lieka atsakingas už 1) bet kokius duomenis ar kitą bet kurios duomenų bazės turinį, kurį jis padaro prieinamą IBM, 2) duomenų prieigos, apsaugos, kodavimo, naudojimo bei duomenų perdavimo (įskaitant ir bet kokius asmeninius duomenis) procedūrų ir kontrolės pasirinkimą ir vykdymą ir 3) visų duomenų bazių ir visų saugomų duomenų atsarginių kopijų sukūrimą bei jų atkūrimą. Licenciatas nesiųs ir nesuteiks IBM prieigos prie asmeninės informacijos, nepriklausomai nuo to, kokios formos ji yra, ir bus atsakingas už pagrįstas išlaidas, kurias IBM patirs dėl tokios informacijos klaidingo perdavimo IBM arba jei IBM prarastų ar paskelbtų tokią informaciją, taip pat ir išlaidas, susijusias su trečiųjų šalių iškeltais ieškiniais.

10. Atsakomybės apribojimas

Apribojimai, pateikti 10 skyriuje (Atsakomybės apribojimas) yra taikomi tiek, kiek leidžia taikomi įstatymai ir neleidžiama atsisakyti sutartyse.

10.1 Dalykai, už kuriuos IBM atsakinga

Gali susiklostyti tokios aplinkybės, kad dėl IBM ar kitų įsipareigojimų nevykdymo Licenciatui būtų suteikta teisė gauti žalos atlyginimą iš IBM. Neatsižvelgiant į pagrindą, pagal kurį Licenciatas gauna teisę reikalauti iš IBM atlyginti žalą (įskaitant esminį pažeidimą, aplaidumą, faktų iškraipymą arba kitą sutarties ar civilinės teisės pažeidimą), išskyrus bet kokią atsakomybę, kurios negalima atsisakyti arba apriboti remiantis atitinkamais įstatymais, visa IBM atsakomybė dėl visų pretenzijų, susijusių su kiekviena Programa, neviršys 1) žalos dėl kūno sužalojimo (įskaitant mirtį), žalos nekilnojamajam turtui ir materialiajam asmeniniam turtui atlyginimo; 2) bet kokios kitos faktinės tiesioginės žalos, įskaitant mokesčius (jei už Programą mokama fiksuotais terminais, taikomi 12 mėnesių mokesčiai) už Programą, dėl kurios pateiktas ieškinys.

Šis apribojimas taip pat taikomas visiems IBM Programos kūrėjams ir tiekėjams. Tai yra didžiausia IBM ir jos Programos kūrėjų ir tiekėjų kolektyvinės atsakomybės suma.

10.2 Dalykai, už kuriuos IBM nėra atsakinga

JOKIU ATVEJU IBM, JOS PROGRAMOS KŪRĖJAI AR TIEKĖJAI NĖRA ATSAKINGI UŽ ŠIUOS DALYKUS, NET JEI JIEMS BUVO PRANEŠTA APIE TOKIŲ APLINKYBIŲ ATSIRADIMO GALIMYBĘ:

a. DUOMENŲ PRARADIMĄ AR SUGADINIMĄ;

b. SPECIALIUOSIUS, ATSITIKTINIUS, BAUDINIUS AR NETIESIOGINIUS NUOSTOLIUS, ARBA BET KOKIUS PRIEŽASTINIUS EKONOMINIUS NUOSTOLIUS; ARBA

c. PRARASTĄ PELNĄ, VERSLĄ, PAJAMAS, PRESTIŽĄ AR PLANUOTAS SUTAUPYTI LĖŠAS.

11. Sąlygų laikymosi tikrinimas

11 skyriuje (Sąlygų laikymosi tikrinimas), „ILAN Programos sąlygos” reiškia 1) šią Sutartį ir jos pataisymus bei IBM pateiktus sandorio dokumentus, ir 2) IBM programinės įrangos politiką, kurią galima rasti IBM Programinės įrangos politikos svetainėje (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), įskaitant, bet neapsiribojant, politiką, susijusią su atsarginėmis kopijomis, pagalbinės talpos kainų nustatymu bei informacijos perkėlimu.

11 skyriuje pateikiamos teisės ir įsipareigojimai taikomi visą Programos licencijos galiojimo laiką bei dvejus metus pasibaigus galiojimui.

11.1 Tikrinimo procesas

Licenciatas sutinka sukurti, išsaugoti ir pateikti IBM bei jos auditoriams tikslias rašytines ataskaitas, sistemos įrankių išvestis ir kitą sistemos informaciją, kuri leistų įvertinti, ar Licenciatas, naudodamasis visomis Programomis, laikosi ILAN programos sąlygų, įskaitant, bet neapsiribojant, visas IBM licencijavimo ir kainų nustatymo sąlygas. Licenciatas yra atsakingas, kad 1) tai neviršytų jo Įgaliotojo naudojimo ribų ir 2) atitiktų ILAN Programos sąlygas.

Priimtinai perspėjusi, IBM gali patikrinti, kaip Licenciatas laikosi ILAN programos sąlygų visose darbo vietose ir visose aplinkose, kuriose Licenciatas naudojasi Programomis (bet kokiu tikslu), kurioms taikomos ILAN programos sąlygos. Toks patikrinimas bus atliktas taip, kad kuo mažiau sutrikdytų Licenciato veiklą, ir gali būti atliekamas Licenciato patalpose darbo valandomis. Tikrinti IBM gali samdyti nepriklausomą trečiąjį asmenį, jei IBM ir trečiasis asmuo yra pasirašę konfidencialumo sutartį.

11.2 Sprendimas

Jei tikrinimo metu paaiškės, kad Licenciatas naudojosi kuria nors Programa, viršydamas Įgaliotojo naudojimo ribas, ar kitu būdu nesilaikė ILAN programos sąlygų, IBM praneš apie tai Licenciatui raštu. Licenciatas sutinka nedelsdamas tiesiogiai IBM padengti išlaidas, kurias IBM nurodo sąskaitoje faktūroje, už 1) bet kokį naudojimosi perviršį, 2) palaikymą, suteiktą šiam perviršiui per naudojimo laikotarpį arba dvejus metus, atsižvelgiant į tai, kuris laikotarpis trumpesnis, ir 3) kitas išlaidas bei įsipareigojimus, nustatytus tikrinimo metu.

12. Trečiųjų šalių pastabos

Programoje gali būti trečiųjų šalių kodas, kurį IBM, ne trečioji šalis, suteikia Licenciatui, remdamasi šia Sutartimi. Jei yra pastabų apie trečiųjų šalių kodą („Trečiųjų šalių pastabos”), jos įtrauktos tik Licenciatui informuoti. Šios pastabos pateikiamos Programos faile (-uose) PASTABOS. Informacija, kaip gauti šaltinio kodą tam tikram trečiosios šalies kodui, pateikta skyriuje „Trečiųjų šalių pastabos”. Jei Trečiųjų šalių pastabose IBM trečiosios šalies kodą nurodo kaip „Modifikuojamą trečiosios šalies kodą”, IBM leidžia Licenciatui 1) modifikuoti Modifikuojamą trečiosios šalies kodą ir 2) atkurti kodą tų Programos modulių, kurie tiesiogiai siejasi su Modifikuojamu trečiosios šalies kodu, su sąlyga, kad tai daroma tik norint suderinti Licenciato modifikacijas su trečiosios šalies kodu. IBM aptarnavimo ir techninės pagalbos įsipareigojimai, jei tokie yra, taikomi tik nemodifikuotai Programai.

13. Bendrosios nuostatos

a. Joks šios Sutarties punktas neturi įtakos įstatymų numatytoms vartotojų teisėms, kurias sutartis galėtų panaikinti ar apriboti.

b. Tais atvejais, kai Licenciatui IBM Programas pateikia materialios formos, IBM savo siuntimo ir pristatymo įsipareigojimus įvykdo, perdavusi Programas IBM paskirtam vežėjui, nebent Licenciatas ir IBM raštu susitarė kitaip.

c. Jeigu kuri nors šios Sutarties nuostata laikoma netekusi galios ar neturinti ieškinio galios, kitos šios Sutarties nuostatos lieka galioti.

d. Licenciatas sutinka laikytis visų taikomų eksporto ir importo įstatymų bei taisyklių, tarp jų JAV embargo ir sankcijų taisyklių bei eksporto draudimų tam tikriems galutiniams vartotojams.

e. Licenciatas įgalioja „International Business Machines Corporation“ ir jos filialus (bei jų teisių perėmėjus, rangovus ir IBM verslo partnerius) laikyti ir naudoti Licenciato verslo sandorio informaciją, neatsižvelgiant į sandorių vietą, susijusią su IBM produktais ir paslaugomis, arba IBM ir Licenciato verslo ryšiams palaikyti.

f. Kiekviena šalis, prieš iškeldama ieškinį kitai šaliai dėl Sutarties įsipareigojimų nevykdymo, pirmiausia suteikia galimybę įvykdyti tuos įsipareigojimus. Šalys bando gera valia išspręsti iškilusius ginčus, nesutarimus ar ieškinius, susijusius su šia Sutartimi.

g. Jei kitaip nereikalauja taikomi įstatymai, ir tai nepanaikina bei neapriboja sutarties įsipareigojimų, 1) nė viena šalis nesiims jokių teisinių veiksmų dėl jokio ieškinio, susijusio su šia Sutartimi, jei yra praėję dveji metai nuo įvykio pradžios; ir 2) pasibaigus šiam terminui bet koks ieškinys ir su juo susijusios atitinkamos teisės netenka galios.

h. Nei Licenciatas, nei IBM neatsako už savo įsipareigojimų nevykdymą dėl nuo šalių nepriklausančių priežasčių.

i. Šioje Sutartyje nenumatomos jokios trečiųjų šalių teisės ar veiksmai, ir IBM nėra atsakinga už jokius trečiųjų šalių ieškinius, pateiktus Licenciatui, išskyrus atvejus, nurodytus 10.1 poskyryje (Dalykai, už kuriuos IBM atsakinga), kai IBM juridiškai atsako trečiajai šaliai už kūno sužalojimus (taip pat mirtį) ar turtinę žalą.

j. Pasirašydamos šią Sutartį, nė viena šalis nesitiki įsipareigojimų vykdymo, nenumatyto Sutartyje, įskaitant, bet neapsiribojant, įsipareigojimus, susijusius su: 1) Programos veikimu; 2) kitų šalių patirtimi ar rekomendacijomis; arba 3) bet kokiais Licenciato gautais rezultatais.

k. Programoms reklamuoti, parduoti ar aptarnauti IBM yra pasirašiusi sutartis su tam tikromis organizacijomis (vadinamomis IBM verslo partneriais). IBM verslo partneriai yra nepriklausomos ir atskirai nuo IBM veikiančios institucijos. IBM nėra atsakinga už IBM verslo Partnerių veiksmus ar pareiškimus, ar jų įsipareigojimus Licenciatui.

l. Licencijos ir intelektinės nuosavybės nuostolių kompensacijos sąlygos, nurodytos kitose Licenciato sutartyse su IBM (tokiose, kaip IBM kliento sutartis) netaikomos šios Sutarties suteikiamos Programos licencijoms.

m. Abi šalys sutinka, kad visa informacija, kuria pasikeičiama, yra nekonfidenciali. Jei bet kuri iš šalių pageidauja keistis konfidencialia informacija, tai bus atliekama remiantis pasirašyta sutartimi dėl konfidencialumo;

14. Geografinė veiklos sfera ir taikoma teisė

14.1 Taikoma teisė

Abi šalys sutinka, kad vykdydamos, aiškindamos ir įgyvendindamos visas Licenciato ir IBM teises, prievoles ir įsipareigojimus, kylančius ar susijusius su šios Sutarties turiniu, taikys valstybės, kurioje Licenciatas įsigijo Programos licenciją, įstatymus, nepaisant teisės principų prieštaravimų.

Jungtinių Tautų Konvencija dėl tarptautinių prekių pirkimo ir pardavimo sutarčių netaikoma.

14.2 Jurisdikcija

Visos teisės, prievolės ir įsipareigojimai yra pavaldūs Valstybės, kurioje Licenciatas įgijo Programos licenciją, teismams.

2 dalis - konkrečiai šaliai taikomos sąlygos

Šios sąlygos pakeičia arba modifikuoja Lietuvoje suteiktų licencijų sąlygas, nurodytas 1 dalyje. Visos 1 dalyje nurodytos sąlygos, kurių šios pataisos nepakeičia, išlieka nepakeistos ir galiojančios. 2 dalis išdėstoma taip:

* 1 dalies 14 skyriaus (Taikoma teisė ir jurisdikcija) su šalimis susijusios pataisos ir

* Europos, Vidurinių Rytų ir Afrikos šalyse taikomos kitų Sutarties sąlygų pataisos.

1 dalies 14 skyriaus (Taikoma teisė ir jurisdikcija) su šalimis susijusios pataisos

14.1 Taikoma teisė

Skyriaus „14.1 Taikoma teisė“ 1 pastraipos frazė „valstybės, kurioje Licenciatas įsigijo Programos licenciją, įstatymus“ Lietuvoje pakeičiama šiomis frazėmis:

Suomijos įstatymus.

14.3 Arbitražas

Ši pastraipa pridedama kaip naujas poskyris „14.3 Arbitražas“, nes ji taikoma Lietuvoje. Šio 14.3 poskyrio nuostatos turi aukštesnę teisinę galią nei poskyrio 14.2 Jurisdikcija nuostatos iki ribos, numatytos taikomuose vietos teisės aktuose ir reglamentuose:

Visi su šia Sutartimi susiję ginčai bus galutinai sprendžiami arbitražo teisme, kuris vyks Helsinkyje, Suomijoje, remiantis tuo metu galiojančiais Suomijos arbitražo teisės aktais. Kiekviena šalis paskirs vieną arbitrą. Arbitrai kartu paskirs pirmininką. Jei arbitrams nepavyks susitarti ir paskirti pirmininko, jį paskirs Helsinkio centriniai pramonės ir prekybos rūmai.

ZAAKCEPTOWANIE PRZEZ UŻYTKOWNIKA NINIEJSZYCH WARUNKÓW W IMIENIU LICENCJOBIORCY OZNACZA, ŻE UŻYTKOWNIK GWARANTUJE POSIADANIE PEŁNYCH UPRAWNIEŃ DO PODPORZĄDKOWANIA LICENCJOBIORCY NINIEJSZYM WARUNKOM. JEŚLI UŻYTKOWNIK NIE WYRAŻA ZGODY NA NINIEJSZE WARUNKI,

* NIE BĘDZIE POBIERAĆ, INSTALOWAĆ, KOPIOWAĆ, OTWIERAĆ, KLIKAĆ PRZYCISKU "AKCEPTUJĘ" ANI UŻYWAĆ PROGRAMU W INNY SPOSÓB; ORAZ

* NATYCHMIAST ZWRÓCI NIEWYKORZYSTANE NOŚNIKI ORAZ DOKUMENTACJĘ PODMIOTOWI, OD KTÓREGO NABYŁ PROGRAM, ABY UZYSKAĆ ZWROT EWENTUALNEJ ZAPŁACONEJ KWOTY. JEŚLI PROGRAM ZOSTAŁ POBRANY, NALEŻY ZNISZCZYĆ WSZELKIE JEGO KOPIE.

1. Definicje

"Autoryzowane Używanie" - określa poziom upoważnienia Licencjobiorcy do wykonywania lub uruchamiania Programu. Poziom ten może być mierzony liczbą użytkowników, liczbą milionów jednostek serwisowych (millions of service units - MSU), liczbą procesorowych jednostek wartości (Processor Value Units - PVU) lub w inny sposób określony przez IBM.

"IBM" - oznacza International Business Machines Corporation lub jedno z przedsiębiorstw podporządkowanych IBM Corp.

"Informacje Licencyjne" ("LI") - oznaczają dokument zawierający informacje i inne warunki dodatkowe na temat Programu. Dokument "Informacje Licencyjne" dla Programu jest dostępny pod adresem: www.ibm.com/software/sla. Informacje Licencyjne można też znaleźć w katalogu Programu, używając komend systemowych. Dokument ten może też być zawarty w Programie.

"Program" - oznacza oryginał oraz pełne lub częściowe kopie: 1) instrukcji i danych w formie zapisu maszynowego, 2) komponentów, plików i modułów, 3) zapisów audiowizualnych (takich jak obrazy, tekst, nagrania lub ilustracje), 4) odnoszących się do Programu materiałów licencjonowanych (takich jak klucze i dokumentacja).

2. Struktura Umowy

Niniejsza Umowa zawiera Część 1 - Warunki ogólne, Część 2 - Warunki specyficzne dla poszczególnych krajów (o ile mają zastosowanie) oraz Informacje Licencyjne, które razem tworzą kompletną umowę między Licencjobiorcą i IBM dotyczącą używania Programu. Umowa ta zastępuje wszelkie wcześniejsze ustne lub pisemne ustalenia dokonane między Licencjobiorcą i IBM w zakresie używania Programu. W przypadku jakiejkolwiek sprzeczności, warunki dokumentu "Informacje Licencyjne" mają znaczenie rozstrzygające nad warunkami obu Części.

3. Udzielenie licencji

Program ten jest własnością IBM lub dostawcy IBM. Program ten jest chroniony prawem autorskim i stanowi przedmiot umowy licencyjnej, a nie umowy sprzedaży.

IBM udziela Licencjobiorcy niewyłącznej licencji na 1) używanie Programu do poziomu Autoryzowanego Używania określonego na fakturze, 2) wykonywanie i instalowanie kopii na potrzeby takiego Autoryzowanego Używania oraz 3) wykonywanie kopii zapasowych, pod warunkiem że

a. Licencjobiorca nabył Program legalnie i przestrzega warunków niniejszej Umowy;

b. taka kopia zapasowa nie będzie używana dopóki Program, z którego została zrobiona, będzie działać;

c. Licencjobiorca powieli wszelkie uwagi dotyczące praw autorskich oraz wszelkie informacje o prawach własności na każdej pełnej lub częściowej kopii Programu;

d. Licencjobiorca zapewni, że jakakolwiek osoba korzystająca z Programu (lokalnie lub zdalnie) 1) dokonuje tego jedynie w imieniu Licencjobiorcy oraz 2) przestrzega warunków niniejszej Umowy;

e. Licencjobiorca nie będzie 1) używać, kopiować, modyfikować ani dystrybuować Programu z wyjątkiem sytuacji wyraźnie wskazanych w niniejszej Umowie; 2) deasemblować, dekompilować Programu i dokonywać jego translacji w inny sposób ani odtwarzać kodu źródłowego, z wyjątkiem sytuacji dozwolonych przez bezwzględnie obowiązujące przepisy prawa, bez możliwości wyłączenia go w drodze umowy; 3) używać jakichkolwiek komponentów Programu, jego plików, modułów, treści audiowizualnych ani związanych z nim materiałów licencjonowanych niezależnie od Programu; 4) udzielać dalszych licencji na Program, wypożyczać go ani wydzierżawiać; oraz

f. jeśli Licencjobiorca nabywa niniejszy Progam jako Progam Dodatkowy, to będzie go używać jedynie do obsługi Programu Głównego, zgodnie z ograniczeniami określonymi w licencji na Program Główny lub, jeśli Licencjobiorca nabywa Program jako Program Główny, to będzie używać wszystkich Programów Dodatkowych jedynie w celu obsługi tego Programu, zgodnie z ograniczeniami określonymi w niniejszej Umowie. Na potrzeby punktu "f" przyjmuje się, że "Program Dodatkowy" oznacza Program stanowiący część innego Programu IBM ("Program Główny"), określany jako Program Dodatkowy w Informacjach Licencyjnych dla Programu Głównego. (W celu nabycia oddzielnej licencji na używanie Programu Dodatkowego bez ograniczeń, Licencjobiorca powinien skontaktować się z podmiotem, od którego nabył Program Dodatkowy).

Niniejsza licencja ma zastosowanie do każdej kopii Programu wykonanej przez Licencjobiorcę.

3.1 Nowsze wersje Programu, aktualizacje i poprawki

3.1.1 Nowsze wersje Programu

Jeśli Program zostanie zastąpiony Programem nowszej wersji, licencja na zastępowany Program wygasa ze skutkiem natychmiastowym.

3.1.2 Aktualizacje i poprawki

Otrzymanie przez Licencjobiorcę aktualizacji lub poprawek do Programu oznacza, że Licencjobiorca akceptuje wszelkie dodatkowe lub odmienne warunki mające zastosowanie do takich aktualizacji i poprawek, określone w Informacjach Licencyjnych dla Programu. W przypadku braku dodatkowych lub odmiennych warunków, aktualizacje i poprawki podlegają wyłącznie postanowieniom niniejszej Umowy. Jeśli Program zostanie zastąpiony aktualizacją, Licencjobiorca wyraża zgodę na natychmiastowe zaprzestanie korzystania z zastępowanej wersji Programu.

3.2 Licencje czasowe

Jeśli IBM licencjonuje Program na wyznaczony termin, to licencja udzielona Licencjobiorcy kończy się wraz z końcem wyznaczonego terminu, chyba że Licencjobiorca i IBM wyrażą zgodę na jej odnowienie.

3.3 Czas trwania i rozwiązanie

Niniejsza Umowa obowiązuje do momentu jej rozwiązania.

IBM może rozwiązać licencję udzieloną Licencjobiorcy, jeśli Licencjobiorca nie będzie przestrzegać warunków niniejszej Umowy.

Jeśli licencja zostanie rozwiązana przez którąkolwiek ze Stron z dowolnej przyczyny, Licencjobiorca wyraża zgodę na natychmiastowe zaprzestanie używania Programu oraz zniszczenie wszelkich posiadanych jego kopii. Wszelkie postanowienia niniejszej Umowy, które ze względu na swój charakter pozostają w mocy po jej rozwiązaniu, będą mieć zastosowanie do momentu ich wypełnienia i obowiązywać będą następców prawnych i cesjonariuszy obu Stron.

4. Opłaty

Ewentualne opłaty są naliczane na podstawie nabytego poziomu Autoryzowanego Używania, określonego na fakturze. IBM nie zwraca wcześniej wniesionych lub należnych opłat ani nie uwzględnia ich w rozliczeniach, chyba że niniejsza Umowa stanowi inaczej.

Jeśli Licencjobiorca zamierza podwyższyć poziom Autoryzowanego Używania, musi on powiadomić z wyprzedzeniem IBM lub autoryzowanego reselera IBM i wnieść odpowiednie opłaty.

5. Podatki

Jeśli odpowiednie władze nałożą na Program opłatę skarbową, podatek, opłatę egzekucyjną lub prowizję, z wyłączeniem opłat wynikających z dochodu netto IBM, Licencjobiorca zgadza się uiścić taką opłatę w kwocie określonej na fakturze lub dostarczyć dokumentację stwierdzającą prawo do zwolnienia z tej opłaty. Od daty nabycia Programu Licencjobiorca ponosi odpowiedzialność z tytułu należnego podatku pośredniego. Jeśli odpowiednie władze nałożą opłatę skarbową, podatek, opłatę egzekucyjną lub prowizję w związku z importem lub eksportem, transferem, uzyskaniem dostępu bądź korzystaniem z Programu poza krajem, w którym została udzielona licencja pierwotnemu Licencjobiorcy, to Licencjobiorca przyjmuje na siebie odpowiedzialność za wszelkie nałożone opłaty oraz za ich uiszczenie.

6. Gwarancja zwrotu pieniędzy

Jeśli z jakiegokolwiek powodu Licencjobiorca nie jest zadowolony z Programu, a jest pierwotnym Licencjobiorcą, to może rozwiązać licencję i uzyskać zwrot kwoty zapłaconej za Program (o ile płatność taka miała miejsce) pod warunkiem zwrotu Programu do podmiotu, od którego go nabył, w ciągu 30 dni od daty faktury. Jeśli licencja jest licencją czasową podlegającą odnowieniu, to Licencjobiorca może otrzymać zwrot kwoty pod warunkiem, że Program zostanie zwrócony w ciągu pierwszych 30 dni początkowego okresu obowiązywania. W przypadku pobrania Programu drogą elektroniczną Licencjobiorca powinien skontaktować się z podmiotem, od którego nabył Program, aby dowiedzieć się, w jaki sposób uzyskać zwrot kwoty.

7. Przeniesienie Programu

Licencjobiorca może przenieść Program oraz wszelkie przysługujące mu prawa i obowiązki licencyjne na osobę trzecią, o ile osoba taka zaakceptuje warunki niniejszej Umowy. Jeśli licencja zostanie rozwiązana przez którąkolwiek ze Stron z dowolnej przyczyny, to Licencjobiorca nie ma prawa do przeniesienia Programu na osobę trzecią. Licencjobiorca nie może przenosić części 1) Programu ani 2) praw do Autoryzowanego Używania Programu. Wraz z przeniesieniem Programu Licencjobiorca jest zobowiązany do przeniesienia egzemplarza niniejszej Umowy w postaci wydruku, łącznie z dokumentem "Informacje Licencyjne". Licencja Licencjobiorcy wygasa natychmiast po dokonaniu takiego przeniesienia.

8. Brak gwarancji

Z ZASTRZEŻENIEM BEZWZGLĘDNIE OBOWIĄZUJĄCYCH WARUNKÓW, KTÓRYCH NIE MOŻNA WYKLUCZYĆ, IBM NIE UDZIELA JAKICHKOLWIEK GWARANCJI (W TYM TAKŻE RĘKOJMI) ORAZ NIE USTALA WARUNKÓW, ZARÓWNO WYRAŹNYCH JAK I DOMNIEMANYCH, DLA PROGRAMU I EWENTUALNEGO WSPARCIA, A W SZCZEGÓLNOŚCI DOMNIEMANYCH GWARANCJI LUB WARUNKÓW PRZYDATNOŚCI HANDLOWEJ, PRZYDATNOŚCI DO OKREŚLONEGO CELU, ZADOWALAJĄCEJ JAKOŚCI, PRAWA WŁASNOŚCI ORAZ GWARANCJI LUB WARUNKÓW NIENARUSZANIA PRAW OSÓB TRZECICH.

USTAWODAWSTWA NIEKTÓRYCH KRAJÓW NIE DOPUSZCZAJĄ WYŁĄCZENIA WYRAŹNYCH LUB DOMNIEMANYCH GWARANCJI. W ZWIĄZKU Z TYM POWYŻSZE WYŁĄCZENIE MOŻE NIE MIEĆ ZASTOSOWANIA DO LICENCJOBIORCY. W TAKIM PRZYPADKU CZAS TRWANIA TAKICH GWARANCJI JEST OGRANICZONY DO MINIMALNEGO OKRESU WYMAGANEGO PRZEZ PRAWO. PO TYM OKRESIE NIE BĘDĄ OBOWIĄZYWAĆ ŻADNE GWARANCJE. USTAWODAWSTWA NIEKTÓRYCH KRAJÓW NIE DOPUSZCZAJĄ OGRANICZENIA CZASU TRWANIA GWARANCJI DOMNIEMANYCH, W ZWIĄZKU Z TYM POWYŻSZE OGRANICZENIE MOŻE NIE MIEĆ ZASTOSOWANIA DO LICENCJOBIORCY. LICENCJOBIORCY MOGĄ PRZYSŁUGIWAĆ INNE PRAWA, W ZALEŻNOŚCI OD OBOWIĄZUJĄCEGO W DANYM KRAJU USTAWODAWSTWA.

ZASTRZEŻENIA I WYKLUCZENIA ZAWARTE W PARAGRAFIE 8 OBOWIĄZUJĄ RÓWNIEŻ PROGRAMISTÓW I DOSTAWCÓW IBM.

PRODUCENCI, DOSTAWCY I WYDAWCY PROGRAMÓW INNYCH NIŻ PROGRAMY IBM MOGĄ DOSTARCZAĆ SWOJE WŁASNE GWARANCJE.

IBM NIE ŚWIADCZY ŻADNYCH USŁUG WSPARCIA, CHYBA ŻE IBM OKREŚLI INACZEJ. W TAKIM PRZYPADKU WSZELKIE USŁUGI WSPARCIA ŚWIADCZONE PRZEZ IBM PODLEGAJĄ ZASTRZEŻENIOM I WYŁĄCZENIOM NINIEJSZEGO PARAGRAFU 8.

9. Dane i bazy danych Licencjobiorcy

W celu udzielenia Licencjobiorcy pomocy przy określeniu przyczyny problemu z Programem, IBM może zażądać, aby Licencjobiorca 1) zezwolił IBM na zdalny dostęp do swoich systemów lub 2) przesłał do IBM informacje na temat swoich systemów lub dane systemowe. Jednakże IBM nie jest zobowiązany do zapewnienia takiej pomocy, chyba że IBM i Licencjobiorca podpiszą oddzielną umowę, w ramach której IBM wyrazi zgodę na świadczenie na rzecz Licencjobiorcy tego rodzaju wsparcia w zakresie przekraczającym zobowiązania IBM określone niniejszą Umową. W każdym przypadku IBM wykorzystuje informacje o błędach i problemach w celu udoskonalania swych produktów i usług oraz udzielania pomocy przy ich dostarczaniu w ramach powiązanych z nimi ofert wsparcia. Przy realizacji tych celów IBM może korzystać z pomocy oddziałów IBM i podwykonawców IBM (znajdujących się nie tylko w kraju lokalizacji Licencjobiorcy, ale i poza nim), a Licencjobiorca upoważnia IBM do takiego działania.

Licencjobiorca pozostaje odpowiedzialny za 1) wszelkie dane i zawartość bazy danych, które udostępnia IBM, 2) wybór i implementację procedur oraz mechanizmów kontrolnych dotyczących dostępu do danych, ich bezpieczeństwa, szyfrowania, używania i transmisji (w tym wszelkich danych identyfikujących osobę fizyczną) oraz 3) tworzenie i odtwarzanie kopii zapasowych każdej bazy danych i wszelkich gromadzonych danych. Licencjobiorca nie będzie wysyłać ani udostępniać IBM jakichkolwiek informacji identyfikujących osobę fizyczną (w postaci danych lub jakiejkolwiek innej) i będzie odpowiedzialny za uregulowanie uzasadnionych kosztów i innych obciążeń, które może ponieść IBM w związku z omyłkowym udostępnieniem takich informacji IBM bądź za utratę lub ujawnienie takich informacji przez IBM, w tym informacji wynikających z roszczeń osób trzecich.

10. Ograniczenie odpowiedzialności

Ograniczenia i zastrzeżenia paragrafu 10 (Ograniczenie odpowiedzialności) mają zastosowanie w pełnym zakresie i nie są zakazane przepisami obowiązującego prawa, bez możliwości wyłączenia takiego prawa w ramach umowy.

10.1 Sytuacje, w których IBM może ponosić odpowiedzialność

W przypadku wystąpienia określonych okoliczności, za które odpowiedzialność ponosi IBM, a w wyniku których Licencjobiorca doznał szkody, Licencjobiorca będzie uprawniony do uzyskania od IBM odszkodowania. Bez względu na podstawę, na jakiej Licencjobiorca jest uprawniony do domagania się odszkodowania od IBM (włączywszy w to naruszenie istotnych postanowień niniejszej Umowy, niedbalstwo, wprowadzenie w błąd lub inne roszczenia z tytułu odpowiedzialności kontraktowej lub deliktowej), całkowita odpowiedzialność IBM z tytułu wszelkich zsumowanych roszczeń wynikających z lub odnoszących się do każdego Programu bądź wynikających z niniejszej Umowy nie przekroczy kwoty: 1) odpowiedzialności za uszczerbek na zdrowiu (łącznie ze śmiercią) oraz za szkody wyrządzone w nieruchomościach lub majątku ruchomym, 2) w przypadku innych rzeczywistych szkód bezpośrednich - wysokości opłat (jeśli Program podlega opłatom czasowym - wysokości opłat za dwanaście miesięcy) uiszczanych przez Licencjobiorcę za Program będący przedmiotem roszczenia.

Ograniczenie to ma również zastosowanie do programistów i dostawców Programów IBM. Wskazany powyżej zakres odpowiedzialności stanowi całość odpowiedzialności ponoszonej łącznie przez IBM oraz programistów i dostawców Programów IBM.

10.2 Sytuacje, w których IBM nie ponosi odpowiedzialności

W ŻADNYCH OKOLICZNOŚCIACH IBM, ANI TEŻ PROGRAMIŚCI CZY DOSTAWCY PROGRAMÓW IBM, NIE PONOSZĄ ODPOWIEDZIALNOŚCI ZA NASTĘPUJĄCE SZKODY, NAWET JEŚLI ZOSTALI POINFORMOWANI O MOŻLIWOŚCI ICH WYSTĄPIENIA:

a. UTRATĘ LUB USZKODZENIE DANYCH;

b. SZKODY NADZWYCZAJNE, UBOCZNE, WYNIKAJĄCE Z NARUSZENIA DÓBR OSOBISTYCH, POŚREDNIE ORAZ SZKODY, KTÓRYCH NIE MOŻNA BYŁO PRZEWIDZIEĆ PRZY ZAWIERANIU UMOWY, ANI TEŻ

c. UTRACONE ZYSKI, KONTAKTY HANDLOWE, PRZYCHODY, REPUTACJĘ (GOODWILL) ANI PRZEWIDYWANE OSZCZĘDNOŚCI.

11. Weryfikacja zgodności

Na potrzeby niniejszego paragrafu 11 (Weryfikacja zgodności), przyjmuje się, że termin "Warunki ILAN dla Programu" oznacza 1) niniejszą Umowę oraz odpowiednie poprawki i dokumenty transakcyjne dostarczone przez IBM, a także 2) strategie IBM dotyczące oprogramowania, dostępne w serwisie WWW IBM Software Policy (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), a w szczególności strategie dotyczące tworzenia kopii zapasowych, określania cen przy ograniczonej mocy obliczeniowej oraz migracji.

Prawa i obowiązki przedstawione w niniejszym paragrafie 11 obowiązują w okresie licencjonowania Programu na rzecz Licencjobiorcy oraz dwa lata po tym okresie.

11.1 Proces weryfikacji

Licencjobiorca zgadza się tworzyć, przechowywać oraz dostarczać IBM i rewidentom IBM dokładną pisemną dokumentację, dane wyjściowe narzędzi systemowych oraz inne informacje systemowe wystarczające do zapewnienia możliwości weryfikacji, że korzystanie przez Licencjobiorcę ze wszystkich Programów odbywa się zgodnie z Warunkami ILAN dla Programu, a w szczególności ze wszystkimi obowiązującymi warunkami IBM w zakresie licencjonowania i cen. Licencjobiorca jest odpowiedzialny za 1) zapewnienie, że nie został przekroczony poziom Autoryzowanego Używania oraz 2) przestrzeganie zgodności z Warunkami ILAN dla Programu.

IBM może zweryfikować, informując o takim zamiarze z odpowiednim wyprzedzeniem, czy Licencjobiorca przestrzega Warunków ILAN dla Programu we wszystkich ośrodkach i środowiskach, gdzie Licencjobiorca używa Programów do jakichkolwiek celów zgodnie z Warunkami ILAN dla Programu. Weryfikacja taka może być przeprowadzana na terenie Licencjobiorcy, w normalnych godzinach pracy i będzie realizowana w sposób w minimalnym stopniu zakłócający tę pracę. IBM może przy takiej weryfikacji skorzystać z usług niezależnego rewidenta, pod warunkiem, że została z nim podpisana umowa o zachowaniu poufności.

11.2 Postanowienia

IBM poinformuje Licencjobiorcę na piśmie, jeśli weryfikacja wykaże, że Licencjobiorca przekroczył poziom Autoryzowanego Używania lub w inny sposób naruszył Warunki ILAN dla Programu. Licencjobiorca wyraża zgodę na natychmiastowe i bezpośrednie uiszczenie na rzecz IBM opłat wyszczególnionych przez IBM na fakturze z tytułu: 1) używania niezgodnego z Warunkami, 2) świadczenia wsparcia w czasie takiego używania lub przez okres dwóch lat, w zależności od tego, który z tych okresów był krótszy oraz 3) dodatkowych opłat i innych zobowiązań określonych w trakcie przeprowadzonej weryfikacji.

12. Uwagi osób trzecich

Program może zawierać kod osób trzecich, który będzie licencjonowany na rzecz Licencjobiorcy w ramach niniejszej Umowy przez IBM, a nie przez osobę trzecią. Ewentualne Uwagi na temat kodu osób trzecich (Uwagi Osób Trzecich) są dołączane jedynie w celu powiadomienia Licencjobiorcy. Uwagi te można znaleźć w pliku NOTICES dołączonym do Programu. Informacje na temat uzyskania kodu źródłowego dla konkretnego kodu osób trzecich można znaleźć w Uwagach Osób Trzecich. Jeśli w Uwagach Osób Trzecich IBM określi kod osób trzecich jako "Modyfikowany Kod Osób Trzecich", to IBM upoważni Licencjobiorcę do 1) modyfikacji Modyfikowanego Kodu Osób Trzecich oraz 2) odtwarzania kodu źródłowego modułów Programu, które są bezpośrednio wykorzystywane przez Modyfikowany Kod Osób Trzecich pod warunkiem, że czynność ta zostanie podjęta jedynie w celu debugowania modyfikacji Licencjobiorcy na potrzeby takiego kodu osób trzecich. Ewentualne zobowiązania IBM w zakresie usług i wsparcia dotyczą jedynie Programu niezmodyfikowanego.

14.1 Obowiązujące ustawodawstwo

Obie Strony przyjmują jako obowiązujące prawo kraju, w którym licencja na Program została nabyta, oraz wyrażają zgodę na stosowanie takiego prawa przy interpretowaniu oraz egzekwowaniu wszelkich praw, obowiązków i zobowiązań Stron, wynikających z niniejszej Umowy lub mających w jakikolwiek sposób z nią związek, bez odwoływania się do zasad kolizji przepisów prawnych.

Konwencja ONZ dotycząca umów o Międzynarodowej Sprzedaży Towarów (United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods) nie ma zastosowania.

14.2 Jurysdykcja

Wszelkie prawa, obowiązki i zobowiązania podlegają właściwym sądom kraju nabycia licencji na Program przez Licencjobiorcę.

Część 2 - Warunki specyficzne dla poszczególnych krajów

W przypadku licencji udzielanych na terenie Polski, poniższe warunki zastępują lub modyfikują warunki określone w Części 1. Wszystkie warunki Części 1, których nie dotyczy niniejsza poprawka, nie ulegają zmianom i pozostają w mocy. W skład Części 2 wchodzą:

* Zmiany krajowe do Części 1, paragraf 14 (Obowiązujące ustawodawstwo i jurysdykcja) oraz

* Zmiany krajowe do innych warunków Umowy dotyczące Europy, Bliskiego Wschodu i Afryki.

Zmiany krajowe do Części 1, paragraf 14 (Obowiązujące ustawodawstwo i jurysdykcja)

14.1 Obowiązujące ustawodawstwo

Fraza "prawo kraju, w którym licencja na Program została nabyta" w pierwszym akapicie paragrafu 14.1 (Obowiązujące ustawodawstwo) zostaje w przypadku Polski zastąpiona następującym tekstem:

prawo Austrii.

14.3 Arbitraż

Następujący akapit mający zastosowanie w Polsce zostaje dodany jako nowy do paragrafu 14.3 (Arbitraż). Postanowienia paragrafu 14.3 mają znaczenie rozstrzygające nad postanowieniami paragrafu 14.2 (Jurysdykcja) w zakresie, w jakim zezwala na to obowiązujące ustawodawstwo i zasady proceduralne:

Wszelkie kwestie sporne wynikające z niniejszej Umowy lub związane z jej naruszeniem, wypowiedzeniem lub nieważnością będą rozstrzygane w sposób ostateczny zgodnie z Zasadami Postępowania Arbitrażowego i Ugodowego Międzynarodowego Centrum Arbitrażu przy Federalnej Izbie Gospodarczej (Rules of Arbitration and Conciliation of the International Arbitral Center of the Federal Economic Chamber) w Wiedniu (Vienna Rules), przez trzech arbitrów, powołanych zgodnie ze wspomnianymi zasadami. Arbitraż będzie miał miejsce w Wiedniu, w Austrii. Językiem obowiązującym podczas postępowania będzie język angielski. Orzeczenia arbitrów będą ostateczne i wiążące dla obu Stron. Oznacza to, że zgodnie z artykułem 598(2) Austriackiego Kodeksu Postępowania Cywilnego (Austrian Code of Civil Procedure), Strony rezygnują ze stosowania artykułu 595(1) punkt 7 tego Kodeksu. Tym niemniej powyższe warunki w żadnym stopniu nie ograniczają prawa IBM do wszczęcia postępowania przed dowolnym właściwym sądem w kraju instalacji.

ZMIANY KRAJOWE DOTYCZĄCE EUROPY, BLISKIEGO WSCHODU I AFRYKI

KRAJE CZŁONKOWSKIE UNII EUROPEJSKIEJ

8. Brak gwarancji

Następujący tekst został dodany do paragrafu 8 (Brak gwarancji):

W krajach Unii Europejskiej ("UE") klientom przysługują prawa wynikające z obowiązującego ustawodawstwa krajowego, któremu podlega sprzedaż artykułów konsumpcyjnych. Postanowienia zawarte w paragrafie 8 (Brak gwarancji) pozostają bez wpływu na te prawa.

KRAJE CZŁONKOWSKIE UNII EUROPEJSKIEJ I KRAJE WYSZCZEGÓLNIONE PONIŻEJ

Każdy kraj europejski, który uchwalił lokalne akty prawne dotyczące ochrony danych zbliżone do modelu obowiązującego w Unii Europejskiej.

10. Limitação de Responsabilidade

A limitação e a exclusão de responsabilidade descritas nesta Secção 10 (Limitação de Responsabilidade) aplicam-se até ao limite máximo em que não sejam proibidas pela lei aplicável sem a possibilidade de renúncia contratual.

10.1 Itens pelos Quais a IBM Pode Ser Responsável

Podem surgir circunstâncias em que o Licenciado tenha direito de exigir que a IBM o compense por danos sofridos. Independentemente da base sobre a qual o Licenciado tem direito a reclamar por danos causados pela IBM (incluindo incumprimento contratual, negligência, deturpação de factos, ou outra reclamação contratual ou extra contratual) a responsabilidade total da IBM por todas as reclamações em agregado resultantes de, ou relacionadas com cada Programa ou de outra forma resultantes ao abrigo deste Contrato não excederá o montante de quaisquer 1) danos corporais (incluindo morte) e danos em bens móveis e imóveis e 2) outros danos reais directos pelos quais a IBM possa ser legalmente responsável até ao montante máximo dos encargos que o Licenciado pagou pelo Programa (se o Programa estiver sujeito aos encargos de prazo fixo, até ao valor equivalente a doze meses de encargos) que está sujeito à reclamação.

Este limite também se aplica a qualquer entidade que desenvolva Programas e a fornecedores de Programas da IBM. Este é o valor máximo pelo qual a IBM, os seus fornecedores e as entidade que desenvolvem Programas são colectivamente responsáveis.

Os direitos e obrigações estabelecidos nesta Seção 11 permanecem em vigor durante o período em que o Programa estiver licenciado ao Licenciado e nos dois anos subsequentes a esse período.

11.1 Processo de Verificação

O Licenciado concorda em criar, reter e fornecer à IBM e aos seus auditores registos precisos e por escrito, emitidos por ferramentas de sistema e outras informações de sistema que sejam suficientes para possibilitar a verificação auditável de que o uso de todos os Programas pelo Licenciado está em conformidade com os Termos do Programa ILAN, incluindo, sem limitação, todos os termos aplicáveis de licenciamento e de qualificação de preços da IBM. O Licenciado é responsável por garantir que: 1) não excederá o seu Uso Autorizado e 2) permanecerá em conformidade com os Termos do Programa ILAN.

9. Данные и Базы данных Лицензиата

Чтобы помочь Лицензиату определить причину проблемы, связанной с Программой, IBM может запросить, чтобы Лицензиат 1) предоставил IBM удаленный доступ к системе Лицензиата или 2) отправил в IBM информацию о Лицензиате или системные данные. Однако IBM не обязана предоставлять подобную помощь, если IBM и Лицензиат не заключили отдельное письменное соглашение, по которому IBM согласна предоставлять Лицензиату такой вид поддержки, который выходит за пределы обязательств IBM по настоящему Соглашению. В любом случае IBM использует информацию об ошибках и проблемах для улучшения ее продуктов и услуг и для содействия предоставлению соответствующих предложений поддержки. Для этих целей IBM может использовать юридических лиц IBM и субподрядчиков IBM (в том числе, в одной или нескольких странах, отличных от страны, в которой находится Лицензиат), и Лицензиат разрешает IBM действовать таким образом.

Лицензиат остается ответственным за 1) любые данные и содержимое баз данных, доступ к которым Лицензиат предоставляет IBM, 2) выбор и внедрение процедур и средств управления, касающихся доступа, безопасности, шифрования, использования и передачи данных (включая любые персональные данные) и 3) резервное копирование и восстановление любых баз данных и сохраненных данных. Лицензиат не будет отправлять и предоставлять IBM доступ к любой персональной информации (в виде данных или в иной форме) и будет нести ответственность за разумные расходы и иные суммы, которые IBM может понести в связи с ошибочной передачей IBM такой информации, утратой или разглашением IBM подобной информации, включая расходы, возникающие из любых претензий третьих сторон.

10. Ограничение Ответственности

Ограничения и исключения, изложенные в данном Разделе 10 (Ограничение Ответственности), применяются в полном объеме, в котором они не запрещены применимым законодательством без возможности освобождения от обязательств по договору.

10.1 То, за Что IBM Может Нести Ответственность

Могут возникнуть обстоятельства, когда из-за неисполнения обязательств со стороны IBM или по иной причине наступления ответственности Лицензиат имеет право на возмещение убытков со стороны IBM. Независимо от основания, на котором Лицензиат имеет право требовать возмещения убытков от IBM (включая существенное нарушение, небрежность, введение в заблуждение или иное договорное нарушение либо деликтное правонарушение), совокупная ответственность IBM по всем претензиям в целом, возникшим из или связанным с каждой Программой или иным образом возникающим на основании настоящего Соглашения, не будет превышать сумму любых 1) компенсаций за нанесение телесных повреждений (включая смерть) и ущерб, причиненный недвижимому и материальному имуществу, и 2) других фактических прямых убытков в размере, не превышающем суммы, уплаченной Лицензиатом за Программу, являющуюся объектом претензии (если для Программы предусмотрены платежи с фиксированным сроком - не превышающем суммы оплаты за 12 месяцев).

Данное ограничение также применяется ко всем разработчикам и поставщикам Программы IBM. Это максимум, за который IBM и ее разработчики Программы и поставщики все вместе несут ответственность.

10.2 То, за Что IBM Не Несет Ответственности

НИ ПРИ КАКИХ ОБСТОЯТЕЛЬСТВАХ IBM, ЕЕ РАЗРАБОТЧИКИ ПРОГРАММ ИЛИ ПОСТАВЩИКИ НЕ НЕСУТ ОТВЕТСТВЕННОСТИ ЗА ЛЮБОЕ ИЗ НИЖЕСЛЕДУЮЩЕГО, ДАЖЕ ЕСЛИ ОНИ БЫЛИ ПРОИНФОРМИРОВАНЫ О ВОЗМОЖНОСТИ ТАКОВОГО:

a. ПОТЕРЯ ИЛИ ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ ДАННЫХ;

b. ОСОБЫЕ, НЕПРЕДВИДЕННЫЕ ИЛИ НЕПРЯМЫЕ УБЫТКИ ИЛИ ЛЮБЫЕ КОСВЕННЫЕ ЭКОНОМИЧЕСКИЕ УБЫТКИ;

c. УПУЩЕННЫЕ ДОХОДЫ, ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ ПРОВЕДЕНИЯ ДЕЛОВОЙ АКТИВНОСТИ, ПРИБЫЛЬ, РЕПУТАЦИЯ ИЛИ ОЖИДАЕМЫЕ СБЕРЕЖЕНИЯ.

11. Проверка Соблюдения условий

В целях данного Раздела 11 (Проверка Соблюдения условий) термин "Условия Международное Лицензионное Соглашение для Программ без Гарантий (ILAN Program Terms)" означает 1) настоящее Соглашение и применимые дополнения и документы о транзакции, предоставленные IBM, и 2) политики IBM в отношении программного обеспечения, которые можно найти на Web-сайте IBM Software Policy (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), включая, но не ограничиваясь ими, политики, касающиеся резервного копирования, ценообразования на основе неполных мощностей и миграции.

Права и обязанности, изложенные в Разделе 11, остаются в силе в течение периода действия лицензии на Программу для Лицензиата и в течение двух лет после его окончания.

11.1 Процесс Проверки

Лицензиат согласен создавать, сохранять и предоставлять IBM и ее аудиторам точные письменные записи, выходные данные системных средств и другую информацию о системе, которые достаточны для подтверждения того, что Лицензиат использует все Программы в соответствии с ILAN Program Terms, включая, без ограничения, все применимые условия лицензирования и ценообразования IBM. Лицензиат несет ответственность за 1) непревышение уровня Авторизованного Использования и 2) соблюдение ILAN Program Terms.

После разумного уведомления IBM может проверить соблюдение Лицензиатом ILAN Program Terms во всех офисах и во всех средах, в которых Лицензиат использует (в любых целях) Программы, на которые распространяются ILAN Program Terms. Такая проверка будет проводиться способом, который уменьшает помехи для деятельности Лицензиата, и может проходить в помещениях Лицензиата в обычные рабочие часы. IBM может использовать независимого аудитора для помощи в проведении проверки, при условии что у IBM есть письменное соглашение о конфиденциальности с таким аудитором.

11.2 Разрешение споров

Если в ходе любой подобной проверки будет установлено, что Лицензиат использовал какую-либо Программу с превышением уровня Авторизованного Использования или иным образом не соблюдает ILAN Program Terms, IBM направит Лицензиату письменное уведомление. Лицензиат согласен немедленно выплатить непосредственно IBM сумму, указанную IBM в счете, за 1) любое такое использование сверх установленных пределов, 2) дополнительную поддержку для такого использования сверх установленных пределов за меньший из следующих периодов: период такого использования или два года, и 3) любые дополнительные расходы и другие обязательства, выявленные в результате такой проверки.

12. Уведомления Третьих Сторон

Программа может содержать программный код третьей стороны, который IBM, а не третья сторона, лицензирует Лицензиату по настоящему Соглашению. Уведомления, если таковые есть, о программном коде, предоставленном третьей стороной ("Уведомления Третьих Сторон"), приводятся только для сведения Лицензиата. Эти уведомления можно найти в файле (файлах) NOTICES для Программы. Информацию о том, как получить исходный код для того или иного программного кода третьей стороны, можно найти в Уведомлениях Третьих Сторон. Если в Уведомлениях Третьих Сторон IBM определяет программный код, предоставленный третьей стороной, как "Изменяемый Программный код Третьей Стороны", то IBM предоставляет Лицензиату права на 1) изменение Изменяемого Программного кода Третьей Стороны и 2) обратное преобразование модулей Программы, которые непосредственно взаимодействуют с Изменяемым Программным кодом Третьей Стороны, при условии что это делается только с целью отладки изменений, внесенных Лицензиатом в такой программный код третьей стороны. Обязательства IBM по обслуживанию и поддержке, если таковые есть, применяются только к неизмененной Программе.

13. Общие условия

a. Ничто в настоящем Соглашении не затрагивает каких-либо установленных законом прав потребителей, которые не могут быть отклонены или ограничены по договору.

b. Для Программ, предоставляемых IBM Лицензиату на носителях, обязательства IBM по поставке считаются выполненными в момент доставки таких Программ транспортной компании, назначенной IBM, если иное не согласовано в письменном виде между Лицензиатом и IBM.

c. Если какое-либо условие настоящего Соглашения будет признано недействительным или лишенным исковой силы, остальные положения настоящего Соглашения продолжают действовать в полном объеме.

d. Лицензиат согласен соблюдать все применимые законы и правила экспорта и импорта, включая законодательные акты США об эмбарго, санкциях и запрете на экспорт для определенных конечных пользователей или для использования в определенных целях.

e. Лицензиат предоставляет компании International Business Machines Corporation и ее дочерним компаниям (а также их наследникам и правопреемникам, подрядчикам и Бизнес-Партнерам IBM) право на хранение контактной информации Лицензиата и ее использование в любом месте ведения деловой активности, в связи с продуктами и услугами IBM или для дальнейшей поддержки деловых отношений IBM с Лицензиатом.

f. Каждая сторона предоставит другой стороне разумную возможность выполнить свои обязательства до того, как заявит о невыполнении другой стороной ее обязательств по настоящему Соглашению. Стороны будут пытаться добросовестно разрешать все споры, разногласия или претензии между сторонами, относящиеся к настоящему Соглашению.

g. Если иное не предусмотрено применимым законодательством, без возможности отказа от прав по договору или их ограничения, то: 1) ни одна из сторон не будет возбуждать судебные иски в любой форме и по любой претензии, связанной с настоящим Соглашением, позднее чем через два года после возникновения основания для иска, и 2) по истечении данного срока любые подобные претензии и связанные с ними права утрачивают силу.

h. Ни Лицензиат, ни IBM не несут ответственности за невыполнение каких-либо обязательств по причинам, на которые они не могут повлиять.

i. Настоящее Соглашение не создает каких-либо прав или оснований для иска каких-либо третьих лиц, и IBM не несет ответственности за какие-либо претензии третьих лиц к Лицензиату, за исключением того, что разрешено в Подразделе 10.1 (То, за Что IBM Может Нести Ответственность) выше в связи с нанесением телесных повреждений (включая смерть) или повреждением недвижимого или материального движимого имущества, за которые IBM несет юридическую ответственность перед такой третьей стороной.

j. Заключая настоящее Соглашение, ни одна из сторон не полагается на любые заявления, не указанные в данном Соглашении, включая, но не ограничиваясь ими, заявления относительно: 1) производительности или функционирования Программы; 2) мнений или рекомендаций других сторон; или 3) каких-либо результатов или экономической выгоды, которых может достичь Лицензиат.

k. IBM подписала соглашения с некоторыми организациями (именуемыми "Бизнес-Партнерами IBM") о продвижении на рынке, продаже и поддержке определенных Программ. Бизнес-Партнеры IBM остаются самостоятельными и независимыми от IBM компаниями. IBM не несет ответственности за действия или заявления Бизнес-Партнеров IBM или обязательства, которые они имеют перед Лицензиатом.

l. Условия о возмещениях, касающиеся лицензий или интеллектуальной собственности, других соглашений Лицензиата с IBM (например, Соглашения IBM с Заказчиком), не применяются к лицензиям на Программы, предоставляемым в соответствии с настоящим Соглашением.

m. Обе стороны согласны с тем, что вся информация, которой они будут обмениваться, является неконфиденциальной. Если какой-либо из сторон потребуется обмен конфиденциальной информацией, то таковой будет осуществляться по письменному соглашению о конфиденциальности.

14. Географические Рамки и Регулирующее Законодательство

14.1 Регулирующее Законодательство

Обе стороны соглашаются на применение законов страны, в которой Лицензиат приобрел лицензию на Программу, чтобы регулировать, интерпретировать и придавать исковую защиту всем правам, обязанностям и обязательствам Лицензиата и IBM, возникающим вследствие или в какой-либо связи с предметом настоящего Соглашения, безотносительно к нормам коллизионного права.

Конвенция Организации Объединенных Наций о договорах международной купли-продажи товаров не применяется.

14.2 Юрисдикция

Все права, обязанности и обязательства подлежат рассмотрению судами страны, в которой Лицензиат приобрел лицензию на Программу.

Часть 2 - Особые Условия для Некоторых Стран

Для лицензий, предоставленных в перечисленных ниже странах, следующие условия заменяют или изменяют соответствующие условия в Части 1. Все условия в Части 1, которые не изменяются этими поправками, остаются в силе без изменений. Часть 2 имеет следующую структуру:

* Поправки для нескольких стран к Части 1, Разделу 14 ("Регулирующее Законодательство и Юрисдикция"); и

* Поправки для стран Европы, Ближнего и Среднего Востока и Африки к другим условиям Соглашения.

Поправки для нескольких стран к Части 1, Разделу 14 ("Регулирующее Законодательство и Юрисдикция")

14.1 Регулирующее Законодательство

Фраза "законов страны, в которой Лицензиат приобрел лицензию на Программу" в первом абзаце подраздела 14.1 ("Регулирующее Законодательство") заменяется в перечисленных ниже странах следующими фразами:

ЕВРОПА, БЛИЖНИЙ И СРЕДНИЙ ВОСТОК И АФРИКА

В Беларуси, Казахстане, Кыргызстане и России: законов Австрии.

14.3 Арбитраж

Следующий абзац добавляется в качестве нового Подраздела 14.3 ("Арбитраж") в той степени, в которой он применяется в перечисленных ниже странах. Положения данного подраздела 14.3 имеют преимущественную силу перед положениями подраздела 14.2 ("Юрисдикция") в той мере, в которой это допускается применимым законодательством и процессуальными нормами.

ЕВРОПА, БЛИЖНИЙ И СРЕДНИЙ ВОСТОК И АФРИКА

В Беларуси, Казахстане, Кыргызстане и России:

Все споры, возникающие из настоящего Соглашения или связанные с его нарушением, прекращением действия или признанием недействительным, подлежат окончательному урегулированию в соответствии с Правилами Арбитража и Урегулирования Международного Арбитражного Центра Федеральной Экономической Палаты в Вене (Венские Правила) тремя арбитрами, назначенными в соответствии с данными правилами. Арбитражное разбирательство будет проводиться в Вене (Австрия), и официальным языком разбирательства будет английский. Решение арбитров является окончательным и обязательным для обеих сторон. Поэтому, в соответствии с параграфом 598 (2) Австрийского Гражданско-процессуального кодекса, стороны в явно выраженной форме отказываются от применения параграфа 595 (1), пункта 7 Кодекса. IBM может, однако, возбудить разбирательство в компетентном суде в стране установки.

ПОПРАВКИ ДЛЯ СТРАН ЕВРОПЫ, БЛИЖНЕГО И СРЕДНЕГО ВОСТОКА И АФРИКИ (EMEA)

Любая европейская страна, которая приняла местные законы о конфиденциальности или защите данных, аналогичные модели ЕС.

Mednarodna licenčna pogodba za programe brez garancije

1. del - splošne določbe

S TEM, KO IMETNIK LICENCE PRENESE, NAMESTI, PREKOPIRA, DOSTOPI DO, KLIKNE GUMB »SPREJMEM« ALI KAKO DRUGAČE UPORABI PROGRAM, SOGLAŠA Z DOLOČBAMI TE POGODBE. ČE SPREJMETE TE DOLOČBE V IMENU IMETNIKA LICENCE, ODGOVARJATE IN JAMČITE, DA IMATE VSA POOBLASTILA ZA POVEZAVO IMETNIKA LICENCE S TEMI DOLOČBAMI. ČE S TEMI DOLOČBAMI NE SOGLAŠATE,

* PROGRAMA NE PRENESITE, NE NAMESTITE, NE PREKOPIRAJTE, NE DOSTOPITE DO NJEGA, NE KLIKNITE GUMBA »SPREJMEM« ALI GA NE UPORABITE IN

* NEMUDOMA VRNITE NEUPORABLJEN MEDIJ IN DOKUMENTACIJO STRANKI, PRI KATERI STE JU PRIDOBILI IN ZAHTEVAJTE POVRAČILO PLAČANEGA ZNESKA. ČE STE PROGRAM PRENESLI, UNIČITE VSE NJEGOVE KOPIJE.

1. Definicije

»Pooblaščena uporaba«- podana raven, s katero lahko imetnik licence uporablja ali izvaja program. Ta raven je lahko merjena s številom uporabnikov, z milijoni storitvenih enot (»MSU-ji«), enotami vrednosti procesorja ("PVU-ji") ali drugimi ravnmi uporabe, ki jih poda IBM.

»IBM« - International Business Machines Corporation ali ena od njegovih podružnic.

»Podatki o licenciranju« (»LI«) - dokument, ki podaja informacije in kakršnekoli dodatne pogoje, specifične za program. Podatki o licenciranju za program so na voljo na naslovu www.ibm.com/software/sla, najdete pa jih lahko tudi v imeniku programa, jih prikažete z vnosom sistemskega ukaza ali si jih ogledate v knjižici, ki je priložena programu.

»Program« - naslednje, vključno z izvirnikom in vsemi celotnimi ali delnimi kopijami: 1) strojno čitljiva navodila in podatki, 2) komponente, datoteke in moduli, 3) avdiovizualna vsebina (kot so slike, besedilo, posnetki ali slike) in 4) s tem povezano licenčno gradivo (kot so ključi in dokumentacija).

2. Struktura pogodbe

Ta pogodba vključuje 1. del - splošne določbe, 2. del - pogoji, značilni za posamezne države (če obstajajo) in podatke o licenciranju, in predstavlja celotno pogodbo med imetnikom licence in IBM-om v zvezi z uporabo programa. Kot takšna nadomešča vse predhodne ustne ali pisne komunikacije med imetnikom licence in IBM-om v zvezi z njegovo uporabo programa. Določbe iz 2. dela lahko nadomestijo ali spremenijo tiste iz 1. dela. V primeru, da pride do navzkrižja, imajo prednost pred obema deloma podatki o licenciranju.

3. Odobritev pogodbe

Lastnik programa je IBM ali IBM-ov dobavitelj. Program se ne prodaja, pač pa se zanj podeljujejo avtorske pravice in licenca.

IBM podeljuje imetniku licence neizključno licenco za 1) uporabo programa do pooblaščene ravni uporabe, ki je določena na računu, 2) izdelavo in namestitev kopij, ki so v podporo takšni pooblaščeni uporabi, in 3) izdelavo varnostne kopije, vendar vse pod pogojem, da

a. je imetnik licence pridobil program na zakonit način in zadovoljuje določbe te pogodbe;

b. se varnostna kopija uporabi samo, če ni mogoče zagnati varnostno prekopiranega programa;

c. imetnik licence opremi vsako kopijo ali delno kopijo programa z vsemi obvestili in drugimi oznakami o avtorskih pravicah, ki dokazujejo lastništvo;

d. imetnik licence zagotovi, da vsak uporabnik, ki dostopi do programa (lokalno ali na daljavo) 1) to naredi samo v imenu imetnika licence in 2) pri tem upošteva določbe te pogodbe;

e. imetnik licence program 1) uporablja, kopira, spreminja ali distribuira izključno v skladu z določbami te pogodbe; 2) v programu ne uporabi vzvratnega prevajanja, vzvratnega inženirstva ali ga kako drugače prevede, razen kot izrecno dopušča zakon brez možnosti odpovedi pogodbe; 3) ne uporabi komponent, datotek, modulov, avdiovizualne vsebine ali s tem povezanega licenčnega gradiva ločeno od programa; ali 4) programa ne podlicencira, daje v najem ali v zakup; in

f. če pridobi imetnik licence ta program kot podporni program, ga bo uporabljal izključno kot podporo glavnemu programu in je predmet vseh omejitev iz licence za glavni program; ali, če pridobi imetnik licence ta program kot glavni program, bo uporabil vse podporne programe samo kot podporo temu programu in zanj veljajo vse omejitve iz te pogodbe. Za namen te točke »f« je »podporni program« tisti program, ki je del drugega IBM-ovega programa (»glavni program«) in je v podatkih o licenciranju glavnega programa določen kot podporni program. (Če želi imetnik licence pridobiti ločeno licenco za podporni program brez teh omejitev, se mora obrniti na stranko, pri kateri je pridobil podporni program.)

Ta licenca velja za vsako kopijo programa, ki jo izdela imetnik licence.

3.1 Zamenjave, posodobitve in popravki

3.1.1 Zamenjave

Če zamenjate program s programom iz zamenjave, licenca za zamenjan program nemudoma preneha veljati.

3.1.2 Posodobitve in popravki

Ko pridobi imetnik licence posodobitev ali popravek, soglaša z vsemi dodatnimi ali drugačnimi določbami, ki veljajo za takšno posodobitev ali popravek, in so določene v njunih podatkih o licenciranju. Če niso podane nobene dodatne ali drugačne določbe, za posodobitev ali popravek velja izključno ta pogodba. Če imetnik licence zamenja program s posodobitvijo, soglaša, da bo nemudoma prenehal uporabljati zamenjan program.

3.2 Licence za določeno dobo

Če dodeli IBM licenco za program za določeno dobo, licenca imetnika licence preneha veljati ob koncu te dobe, razen v primeru, če se imetnik licence in IBM dogovorita, da jo bosta podaljšala.

3.3 Doba in prenehanje veljavnosti

Ta pogodba ostane v veljavi, dokler se je ne odpove.

IBM lahko odpove licenco imetnika licence, če ta ne upošteva določb te pogodbe.

Če katerakoli stranka zaradi kakršnegakoli razloga odpove licenco, imetnik licence soglaša, da bo nemudoma prenehal uporabljati vse kopije programa in jih bo uničil. Vse določbe te pogodbe, ki zaradi svoje narave ostanejo v veljavi tudi po izteku te pogodbe, ostanejo v veljavi do svoje izpolnitve, in veljajo za ustrezne naslednike in pooblaščence obeh pogodbenih strank.

4. Stroški

Stroški (če obstajajo) temeljijo na pridobljeni pooblaščeni uporabi, ki je določena na računu. IBM ne daje nobenih posojil ali povračil za že zapadle ali plačane bremenitve, razen če je to določeno kje drugje v tej pogodbi.

Če želi imetnik licence povečati svojo pooblaščeno uporabo, mora o tem vnaprej obvestiti IBM ali pooblaščenega IBM-ovega prodajalca in plačati vse ustrezne bremenitve.

5. Davki

Če ustrezna služba za program določi takso, davek, pristojbino ali prispevek, kar ne vključuje tistih, ki temeljijo na IBM-ovem čistem dohodku, imetnik licence soglaša, da bo plačal ta znesek, podan na računu, ali pa posredoval dokumente o oprostitvi. Imetnik licence je odgovoren za vse davke na osebno lastnino za program od datuma njegove pridobitve. Če ustrezna služba določi carinsko takso, davek, dajatev ali pristojbino za uvoz ali izvoz, prenos, dostop do ali uporabo programa izven države, v kateri je bila zanj imetniku licence dodeljena licenca, se imetnik licence strinja, da je odgovoren za kakršenkoli zaračunan znesek in ga bo tudi plačal.

6. Garancija za vračilo denarja

Če imetnik licence iz kakršnegakoli vzroka ni zadovoljen s programom in je izvirni imetnik licence, lahko prekliče licenco in pridobi povračilo plačanega zneska (če obstaja) za program, pod pogojem, da imetnik licence vrne program stranki, pri kateri ga je pridobil, v roku 30 dni od datuma računa. Če gre za licenco za določeno obdobje, ki se lahko podaljša, lahko pridobi imetnik licence povračilo samo, če vrne program v prvih 30 dneh začetnega obdobja. Če je imetnik licence prenesel program, naj se za navodila o denarnem vračilu obrne na stranko, pri kateri ga je pridobil.

7. Prenos programa

Imetnik licence lahko prenese program in vse njegove pravice in dolžnosti na drugo stranko samo, če ta stranka soglaša z določbami te pogodbe. Če katerakoli stran zaradi kakršnegakoli vzroka prekine licenco, imetnik licence ne sme prenesti programa na drugo stranko. Imetnik licence ne sme prenesti dela 1) programa ali 2) pooblaščene uporabe programa. Če imetnik licence prenese program, mora prenesti tudi natisnjeno kopijo te pogodbe, vključno s podatki o licenciranju. Licenca imetnika licence preneha veljati nemudoma po prenosu.

8. Brez garancij

V SKLADU S KATERIMIKOLI ZAKONITIMI GARANCIJAMI, KI JIH NI MOGOČE IZKLJUČITI, NE DAJE IBM NOBENIH GARANCIJ ALI POGOJEV, IZRECNIH ALI NAKAZANIH, V ZVEZI S PROGRAMOM ALI PODPORO, ČE SPLOH, KAR VKLJUČUJE TUDI (VENDAR NI OMEJENO NA) KAKRŠNEKOLI NAKAZANE GARANCIJE ALI POGOJE TRŽNOSTI, ZADOVOLJIVE KAKOVOSTI, UPORABNOSTI ZA DOLOČEN NAMEN IN PRAVNI NASLOV TER KAKRŠNEKOLI GARANCIJE ALI POGOJE NEKRŠENJA.

NEKATERE DRŽAVE ALI JURISDIKCIJE NE DOVOLIJO IZKLJUČITVE IZRECNIH ALI NAKAZANIH GARANCIJ, ZATO ZGORNJA OMEJITEV ZA VAS LAHKO NE VELJA. V TEM PRIMERU JE TRAJNOST TAKŠNIH GARANCIJ OMEJENA NA MINIMALNO ZAKONSKO ZAHTEVANO OBDOBJE. PO IZTEKU TEGA ROKA NE VELJA VEČ NOBENA GARANCIJA. NEKATERE DRŽAVE ALI JURISDIKCIJE NE DOVOLIJO OMEJITVE V TRAJANJU NAKAZANIH GARANCIJ, ZATO ZGORNJA OMEJITEV LAHKO NE VELJA ZA IMETNIKA LICENCE. IMETNIKU LICENCE LAHKO PRIPADAJO TUDI DRUGE PRAVICE, KI SE RAZLIKUJEJO OD DRŽAVE DO DRŽAVE IN OD JURISDIKCIJE DO JURISDIKCIJE.

IZKLJUČITVE IN IZVZETJA IZ TEGA 8. RAZDELKA VELJAJO TUDI ZA VSE IBM-OVE RAZVIJALCE IN DOBAVITELJE PROGRAMOV.

PROIZVAJALCI, DOBAVITELJI ALI ZALOŽNIKI PROGRAMOV, KI NISO IBM-OVI, LAHKO PODAJO SVOJE LASTNE GARANCIJE.

IBM NE NUDI PODPORE KAKRŠNEKOLI VRSTE, RAZEN ČE NE DOLOČI DRUGAČE. V TAKŠNEM PRIMERU JE KAKRŠNAKOLI PODPORA, KI JO NUDI IBM, PREDMET IZKLJUČITEV IN IZVZETIJ IZ TEGA 8. RAZDELKA.

9. Podatki in baze podatkov imetnika licence

Da bi imetniku licence pomagali pri osamitvi vzroka težave v programu, lahko IBM od njega zahteva, da 1) omogoči IBM-u oddaljen dostop do svojega sistema ali 2) IBM-u pošlje podatke o licenciranju ali sistemske podatke. Toda IBM ni obvezan nuditi takšne podpore, razen če skleneta IBM in imetnik licence ločeno pisno pogodbo, na podlagi katere IBM soglaša, da bo nudil imetniku licence to vrsto podpore, ki presega obveznosti IBM-a iz te pogodbe. V vsakem primeru bo IBM uporabil informacije o napakah in težavah za izboljšanje svojih izdelkov in storitev in kot pomoč pri nudenju s tem povezanih ponudb za podporo. V ta namen lahko IBM vključi IBM-ove pravne osebe in podpogodbenike (kar vključuje tudi tiste v eni ali več državah, v katerih se ne nahaja imetnik licence), imetnik licence pa daje IBM-u v ta namen pooblastilo.

Imetnik licence ostaja odgovoren za 1) vse podatke in vsebino vseh baz podatkov, ki jih imetnik licence omogoči za IBM, 2) izbiro in uvedbo postopkov in nadzora v zvezi z dostopanjem, zaščito, šifriranjem, uporabljanjem in prenašanjem podatkov (vključno z vsemi osebnimi podatki) in 3) varnostno kopiranje in obnavljanje vseh baz podatkov in shranjenih podatkov. Imetnik licence IBM-u ne bo poslal ali priskrbel dostopa do osebnih informacij, ki so lahko v podatkovni ali kakršnikoli drugi obliki, in bo odgovoren za sprejemljive stroške in druge zneske, ki jih lahko naloži IBM v zvezi s takšnimi informacijami, ki so po nesreči posredovane IBM-u, ali za izgubo ali razkritje takšnih informacij s strani IBM-a, vključno s tistimi, do katerih pride zaradi zahtevkov katerihkoli tretjih strani.

10. Omejitev odgovornosti

Omejitve in izključitve iz tega razdelka 10 (Omejitev odgovornosti) veljajo v celoti, če jih ne prepoveduje veljaven zakon brez možnosti pogodbene odpovedi.

10.1 Primeri, za katere je IBM lahko odgovoren

Zaradi napake IBM-a ali zaradi kakšne druge obveznosti lahko pride do okoliščin, v katerih je imetnik licence od IBM-a upravičen terjati odškodnino. Ne glede na osnovo, na kateri lahko imetnik licence od IBM terja odškodnino (vključno z osnovno kršitvijo, malomarnostjo, napačno predstavitvijo dejstev ali kakšnim drugim pogodbenim ali kazenskim zahtevkom), IBM-ova celotna odgovornost za vse skupne zahtevke, vložene zaradi programa ali v povezavi z njim ali ki so kako drugače vloženi na osnovi te pogodbe, ne preseže zneska 1) škode za telesne poškodbe (vključno s smrtjo) in škode v nepremičninah in v osebnih premičninah in 2) druge dejanske neposredne škode do zneska (če je program predmet bremenitev za določeno obdobje, veljajo 12-mesečne bremenitve), ki ga je plačal imetnik licence za program, ki je predmet zahtevka.

Ta omejitev velja tudi za vse IBM-ove razvijalce in dobavitelje programa, in predstavlja maksimum, za katerega so IBM in razvijalci in dobavitelji programa kolektivno odgovorni.

10.2 Primeri, za katere IBM ni odgovoren

IBM IN NJEGOVI RAZVIJALCI ALI DOBAVITELJI PROGRAMA POD NOBENIMI POGOJI NE ODGOVARJAJO ZA NASLEDNJE PRIMERE, TUDI ČE SO OBVEŠČENI O MOŽNOSTI, DA DO NJIH PRIDE:

a. IZGUBO ALI POŠKODBO PODATKOV;

b. POSEBNO, NAKLJUČNO, KAZENSKO ALI POSLEDIČNO ŠKODO ALI KAKRŠNOKOLI EKONOMSKO POSLEDIČNO ŠKODO; ALI

c. IZGUBLJENE DOBIČKE, POSLOVANJE, DOHODKE, DOBRO IME ALI PRIČAKOVANE PRIHRANKE.

11. Preverjanje skladnosti

Za namene tega 11. razdelka (Preverjanje skladnosti) pomenijo "določbe programa ILAN" 1) to pogodbo in ustrezna dopolnila in transakcijske dokumente, ki jih poda IBM in 2) IBM-ova načela za programsko opremo, ki jih je mogoče najti na IBM-ovem spletnem mestu z načeli za programsko opremo (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), kar vključuje tudi (vendar ni omejeno na) načela, ki se nanašajo na izdelavo varnostnih kopij, določanje cen za podkapaciteto in selitev.

Pravice in obveznosti iz tega razdelka 11 ostanejo v veljavi v obdobju, v katerem je program licenciran za imetnika licence in še dve leti zatem.

11.1 Postopek preverjanja

Imetnik licence soglaša, da bo izdelal, hranil in posredoval IBM-u in njegovim revizorjem natančne pisne zapiske, izhodne podatke sistemskih orodij in druge sistemske informacije, ki zadostujejo za preverjanje, ali uporablja imetnik licence programe v skladu z določbami programa ILAN, kar vključuje tudi (vendar ni omejeno na) vse IBM-ove ustrezne določbe za licenciranje in določanje cen. Imetnik licence mora 1) zagotoviti, da ne preseže svoje pooblaščene uporabe in 2) da upošteva določbe programa ILAN.

Na osnovi predhodnega obvestila lahko IBM na vseh lokacijah in v vseh okoljih, v katerih imetnik licence (za kakršenkoli namen) uporablja programe, preveri skladnost z določbami programa ILAN. Pri takšnem preverjanju bomo poskušali čim manj motiti poslovanje imetnika licence in ga lahko opravimo na lokaciji imetnika licence med običajnimi poslovnimi urami. IBM lahko kot pomoč pri preverjanju vključi neodvisnega revizorja, pod pogojem, da je IBM z njim podpisal pogodbo o zaupnosti.

11.2 Razrešitev

IBM bo imetnika licence v pisni obliki obvestil, če se pri takšnem preverjanju pokaže, da je imetnik licence pri uporabi kateregakoli programa presegal svojo pooblaščeno uporabo ali kako drugače ni upošteval določb programa ILAN. Imetnik licence soglaša, da bo IBM-u nemudoma in neposredno plačal bremenitve, ki jih IBM poda na računu za 1) takšno preseženo uporabo, 2) podporo za takšno preseženo uporabo za trajanje takšne presežene uporabe ali za dve leti (kar je krajše) in 3) vse dodatne stroške in druge obveznosti, ki so ugotovljene kot rezultat takšnega preverjanja.

12. Obvestila za druge proizvajalce

Program lahko vključuje kodo drugega proizvajalca, za katero dodeli v tej pogodbi licenco IBM in ne drug proizvajalec. Opombe (če obstajajo) za kodo drugega proizvajalca ("Obvestila za druge proizvajalce") so vključena zgolj kot informacija za imetnika licence. Ta obvestila boste našli v datoteki (datotekah) OPOMBE programa. Informacije o tem, kako pridobiti izvorno kodo za kodo določenih drugih proizvajalcev, boste našli v razdelku Obvestila za druge proizvajalce. Če IBM v razdelku Obvestila za druge proizvajalce identificira kodo drugega proizvajala kot »kodo drugega proizvajalca z možnostjo spreminjanja«, daje IBM imetniku licence pooblastilo za 1) spreminjanje kode drugega proizvajalca z možnostjo spreminjanja in 2) vzvratno inženirstvo v modulih programa, ki so v neposrednem stiku s kodo drugega proizvajalca z možnostjo spreminjanja, pod pogojem, da gre izključno za namen razhroščevanja (debugging) popravkov imetnika licence v takšni kodi drugega proizvajalca. IBM-ove servisne in podporne obveznosti (če obstajajo) veljajo samo za nespremenjen program.

13. Splošno

a. Noben del te pogodbe ne vpliva na nobene zakonite pravice potrošnikov, ki jih ni mogoče odpovedati ali omejiti s pogodbo.

b. Za programe, ki jih IBM posreduje imetniku licence v materialni obliki, bo IBM izpolnil svoje obveznosti glede dobave in dostave ob dostavi takšnih programov špediterju, ki ga imenuje IBM, razen če se IBM in imetnik licence v pisni obliki ne dogovorita drugače.

c. Če se za katero določbo iz te pogodbe ugotovi, da ni veljavna ali da je ni mogoče uveljaviti, preostale določbe iz te pogodbe ostanejo v polni veljavi.

d. Imetnik licence soglaša, da bo upošteval vse lokalne zakone in predpise v zvezi z izvažanjem in uvažanjem, vključno s predpisi in prepovedmi v povezavi z embargom in sankcijami o izvozu za določene končne uporabe ali za določene uporabnike.

e. Imetnik licence pooblašča družbo International Business Machines Corporation in njene podružnice (in njene naslednike in pooblaščence, pogodbenike in IBM-ove poslovne partnerje) za shranjevanje in uporabo poslovnih kontaktnih informacij imetnika licence tam, kjer poslujejo, v povezavi z IBM-ovimi izdelki in storitvami ali pri pospeševanju IBM-ovega odnosa z imetnikom licence.

f. Vsaka stran bo drugi strani omogočila sprejemljivo priložnost za zadovoljitev določb, preden bo začela trditi, da druga ne zadovoljuje svojih obveznosti iz te pogodbe. Strani bosta poskusili v dobri veri razrešiti vse spore, nesoglasja ali druge zahteve med stranmi v povezavi s to pogodbo.

g. Razen če drugače ne zahteva lokalen zakon brez možnosti pogodbene odpovedi ali omejitve: 1) nobena stranka ne bo sprožila pravnega postopka, ne glede na njegovo obliko, za katerokoli zahtevo, nastalo v povezavo s to pogodbo, več kot dve leti po nastanku vzroka za zahtevo; in 2) po izteku tega časovnega obdobja vsi takšni zahtevki in druge ustrezne pravice, povezane z zahtevkom, zastarajo.

h. Niti imetnik licence niti IBM nista odgovorna za neizpolnitev katerekoli obveznosti zaradi vzrokov, ki jih ni mogoče nadzorovati.

i. Ta pogodba ne daje osnove za nobene pravice ali zahtevke katerihkoli tretjih strank, niti ni IBM odgovoren za nobene zahtevke tretjih strank proti imetniku licence, razen kot dovoljuje zgornji podrazdelek 10.1 (Primeri, za katere je IBM lahko odgovoren) za telesne poškodbe (vključno s smrtjo) ali škodo na nepremičninah ali v osebnih premičninah, za katere je IBM zakonsko odgovoren tej tretji stranki.

j. Ob sklepu te pogodbe se nobena stranka ne zanaša na nobeno predstavitev, ki ni podana v tej pogodbi, kar vključuje tudi (vendar ni omejeno na) kakršnokoli predstavitev, ki se nanaša na: 1) zmogljivost ali delovanje programa; 2) izkušnje ali priporočila drugih strank; ali 3) kakršnekoli rezultate ali prihranke, ki jih lahko ustvari imetnik licence.

k. IBM je z določenimi organizacijami (imenovanimi "IBM-ovi poslovni partnerji") podpisal pogodbe za promoviranje, trženje in podpiranje določenih programov. IBM-ovi poslovni partnerji so neodvisni in ločeni od IBM-a. IBM ni odgovoren za dejanja ali izjave IBM-ovih poslovnih partnerjev ali za obveznosti, ki jih imajo do imetnika licence.

l. Določbe v zvezi z odškodnino za licenco in intelektualno lastnino iz drugih pogodb, ki jih je imetnik licence podpisal z IBM-om (kot je na primer IBM-ova pogodba za stranke), ne veljajo za programske licence, dodeljene s to pogodbo.

m. Obe stranki soglašata, da so vse izmenjane informacije nezaupne. Če katera od strank zahteva izmenjavo zaupnih informacij, bosta sklenili podpisano pogodbo o zaupnosti.

14. Geografsko področje in zakonodaja

14.1 Zakonodaja

Obe pogodbeni stranki soglašata, da bodo zakoni države, v kateri je imetnik licence pridobil licenco za program, uporabljeni za upravljanje, interpretiranje in uveljavljanje vseh ustreznih pravic, dolžnosti in obveznosti imetnika licence in IBM-a, nastalih na osnovi predmeta te pogodbe ali v povezavi z njim, ne glede na navzkrižje zakonskih načel.

Konvencija Združenih narodov v zvezi s pogodbami za mednarodno prodajo blaga ne velja.

14.2 Sodna pristojnost

Vse pravice, dolžnosti in obveznosti bodo obravnavala sodišča v državi, v kateri imetnik licence pridobi licenco za program.

2. del - pogoji, značilni za posamezne države

Za licence, ki so dodeljene v Sloveniji, naslednje določbe nadomeščajo ali spremenijo omenjene določbe iz 1. dela. Vse določbe iz 1. dela, ki jih ti popravki ne spremenijo, ostanejo nespremenjene in v veljavi.

无保证程序的国际许可协议

第一部分 - 通用条款

下载、安装、复制、访问、单击“接受”按钮，或以其他方式使用程序，即表明被许可方同意本协议的条款。如果您代表被许可方接受此类条款，则您陈述并保证您拥有完全的授权以使该被许可方接受此类条款的约束。如果您不同意此类条款，

* 则请勿下载、安装、复制、访问、单击“接受”按钮，或使用程序；并且

* 立即将未使用的介质和文档退还至提供方，以便获得您所支付金额的退款。如果下载了程序，那么请销毁程序的所有副本。

1. 定义

“授权使用” - 被许可方被授权执行或运行程序的指定级别。该级别可按用户数、百万个服务单位（MSUs）、处理器价值单元（PVUs）或其他 IBM 指定的使用级别进行计量。

“IBM” - 国际商业机器公司（International Business Machines Corporation）或其任一子公司。

“许可信息”（“LI”） - 提供与特定程序相关的信息或任何附加条款的文件。程序的 LI 可通过以下站点获取：www.ibm.com/software/sla。该 LI 也可以通过使用系统命令在程序目录下找到，或者作为手册与程序一起提供。

3. 许可授予

程序由 IBM 或 IBM 供应商所有，受版权保护。程序系许可使用，而非出售。

IBM 授予被许可方执行以下操作的非专有许可，以便被许可方：1）在发票中规定的授权使用级别内使用程序，2）制作和安装副本，以支持此类授权使用，3）制作备份副本，前提是

a. 被许可方已合法获取程序，并遵守本协议的条款；

b. 不执行备份副本，除非被备份的程序无法执行；

c. 被许可方须在程序的每一完整副本或部分副本中复制所有的版权声明和其他所有权说明；

d. 被许可方须确保使用程序的所有人员（不论是本地或远程访问）都 1）仅为被许可方的利益使用程序；以及 2）遵守本协议的条款；

e. 被许可方不得 1）使用、复制、修改或分发程序，除非本协议明确许可；2）对本程序进行反汇编、反编译或以其他方式翻译或反向工程；但法律明确许可且不得以约定放弃者除外；3）独立于程序而单独使用程序组件、文件、模块、音像内容或相关许可材料；或 4）再许可、出租或租赁程序；并且

f. 如果被许可方获取本程序作为支持程序，那么被许可方只能将本程序用于支持主程序，并遵守主程序许可中的任何限制条款。或者，如果被许可方获取本程序作为主程序，那么被许可方只能将所有支持程序用于支持本主程序，并遵守本协议中的任何限制条款。本 f 项中的“支持程序”是属于另外一个 IBM 程序（“主程序”）的一部分的程序，并且在“主程序”的 LI 中被标识为“支持程序”。（要获取不带有这些限制的“支持程序”的单独许可，被许可方应联系其获取“支持程序”的供应方。）

此许可适用于被许可方制作的每份程序副本。

3.1 换购、更新、修订和补丁

3.1.1 换购

如果程序被换购程序替换，那么被替换程序的许可将立即被终止。

3.1.2 更新、修订和补丁

被许可方获得程序的更新、修订或补丁时，被许可方须接受其 LI 中规定的适用于此类更新、修订或补丁的任何附加或不同的条款。如果未提供附加或不同条款，那么更新、修订和补丁只需遵守本协议的规定。如果程序被更新替换，被许可方同意立即停止对被替换程序的使用。

3.2 固定期限许可

如果 IBM 授予固定期限的程序许可，那么被许可方的许可将在固定期间结束时被终止，除非被许可方和 IBM 同意续签许可协议。

3.3 期限和终止

本协议在被终止前一直保持有效。

如果被许可方未能遵守本协议条款，则 IBM 可以终止被许可方的许可。

如果许可由于任何理由被任意一方终止，被许可方同意立即停止使用并销毁被许可方制作的程序的所有副本。如果本协议的任何条款因其性质致使其有效期超出本协议终止期限，那么这些条款应一直保持有效，直至履行完毕，并且适用于双方各自的继任者和受让人。

4. 费用

费用（如有）基于发票中规定的所获得的授权使用级别。对于应付或已付款项，IBM 不给予贷记金额或退款，除非本协议中另有规定。

如果被许可方希望提高授权使用级别，那么被许可方必须提前通知 IBM 或经授权的 IBM 经销商，并支付任何适用的费用。

5. 税收

如有任何政府机构对程序征收税款或其他费用（不包括基于 IBM 净收入的部分），则被许可方须同意支付发票中规定的金额，或提供相关税费的豁免文件。获得程序之后，被许可方须自行负责支付有关程序的任何个人财产税。如果由于出口、进口、转让或在原被许可方获取许可的国家或地区之外访问或使用本程序，政府机构因此征收税款或其他费用，那么被许可方同意负责并支付征收的税款或费用。

6. 退款保证

如果被许可方由于任何原因对程序不满意，并且是原被许可方，那么被许可方可以终止本许可，并获得就程序已支付金额的退款（如有），前提是被许可方在发票日期的 30 天内将本程序退还给其取得程序及权利证明的一方。如果许可是可进行续签的固定期限许可，那么只有被许可方在初始期限的前 30 天内退还本程序才能获得退款。如果被许可方下载了程序，则被许可方应与程序提供方联系以了解获得退款的指导。

7. 程序转让

仅当另一方同意本协议的条款时，被许可方方可将程序和所有的许可权利和义务转让至该方。如果许可由于任何理由被任意一方终止，被许可方不得将程序转让给另一方。被许可方不得转让部分 1）程序或 2）程序的授权使用。被许可方转让程序时，还必须转让本协议的一份硬拷贝，包括 LI。转让之后，被许可方的许可将立即被终止。

8. 无保证

除了无法排除的任何法定保证，IBM 不做任何有关本程序或支持（如有）的明示或暗含的保证或条件，包括但不限于任何暗含的有关适销性、令人满意的质量、适用于某种特定用途、所有权及任何不侵权的保证或条件。

某些国家或司法辖区不允许排除明示的或暗含的保证，因此上述除外条款可能并不适用于被许可方。在此情况下，此类保证仅在法律要求的最短保证期限内有效。任何保证在保修期限之后将不再适用。某些国家或司法辖区不允许限制暗含保证的期限，因此上述限制可能并不适用于被许可方。被许可方可能拥有其他权利，此类权利视被许可方所在的国家或司法辖区而定。

本小节 8 中的免责声明和排除条款同样适用于任何 IBM 的程序开发商和供应商。

非 IBM 程序的制造商、供应商或发布商可能提供其自己的保证。

IBM 不提供任何支持，除非 IBM 另行规定。此情况下，IBM 提供的任何支持受本小节 8 中的免责声明和排除条款的约束。

9. 被许可方数据和数据库

为帮助被许可方确定程序问题的根源，IBM 可能要求被许可方 1）允许 IBM 远程访问被许可方的系统，或 2）向 IBM 发送被许可方的信息和系统数据。但是，IBM 没有义务提供此类帮助，除非 IBM 和被许可方签订了单独的书面协议，规定 IBM 须向被许可方提供超出在本协议下 IBM 义务的支持类型。任何情况下，IBM 将使用关于错误和问题的信息来改善其产品和服务，并帮助提供相关的支持。为了这些目的，IBM 可以使用 IBM 实体和分包商（包括被许可方所在国家或地区之外的一个或多个国家或地区的 IBM 实体和分包商），并且被许可方授权 IBM 这样做。

被许可方仍负责 1）被许可方提供给 IBM 的任何数据库的数据和内容；2）选择和实施关于数据访问、安全性、加密、使用和传输（包括任何可识别个人身份的信息）；以及 3）备份和恢复任何数据库及已存储数据。被许可方将不向 IBM 发送任何数据形式或其他形式的可识别个人身份的信息或提供此类信息的访问。如果由于向 IBM 错误发送此类信息或 IBM 丢失或透露此类信息而造成损失，包括任何第三方索赔的损失，那么被许可方将负责支付合理的费用和其他款项。

10. 责任限制

第 10 部分（责任限制）中的限制和除外在不得以合同放弃权利的适用法律未作出禁止性规定的限度内完全适用。

10.1 IBM 可能承担责任的项目

如果发生因为 IBM 违约或须承担其他责任的情况，被许可方有权要求 IBM 赔偿损失。无论被许可方以何种依据要求 IBM 赔偿损失（包括重大违约、过失、失实陈述或其他合约或侵权方面的索赔），IBM 的全部责任仅限于 1）人身伤害（包括死亡）损害赔偿、不动产和有形动产的损害，以及 2）任何其他实际直接损害赔偿，赔偿额最高为 IBM 对作为索赔标的物的程序所收取的费用（如果程序按固定期限许可收费，则最高为 12 个月的收费）。

此责任限制也适用于任何 IBM 的程序开发商和供应商。这是 IBM 与其程序开发商和供应商共同的最高赔偿限额。

10.2 IBM 不承担责任的项目

无论如何，IBM 及其程序开发商和供应商均不对下列各项负责，即使已被告知其发生的可能性：

a. 数据的丢失或损坏；

b. 特别的、附带的、惩罚性的或间接的损害赔偿，或任何后果性经济损害赔偿；或

c. 利润、业务、收入、商誉或预期可节省金额的损失。

11. 合规性验证

此第 11 部分（合规性验证）中，“ILAN 程序条款”指的是 1）本协议和 IBM 提供的适用的补充协议和交易文件，以及 2）IBM 软件政策，该政策可在 IBM 软件政策站点（www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies）上找到，包括但不限于关于备份、次级容量定价和迁移的政策。

第 11 部分规定的权利和义务在程序被许可给被许可方的期限及之后两年内保持有效。

11.1 验证流程

被许可方同意创建、保留并向 IBM 及其审查员提供准确书面记录、系统工具输出结果以及其他系统信息，上述内容应充分以便提供被许可方对所有程序的使用均符合 ILAN 程序条款（包括但不限于所有 IBM 适用的许可和定价申请条款）的可审计的验证。被许可方负责 1）确保其使用不超出授权使用级别，以及 2）始终遵守 ILAN 程序条款。

在事先合理通知的情况下，IBM 可以验证被许可方为了任何目的在所有的地点以及所有环境中对受 ILAN 程序条款管辖的程序的使用是否遵守 ILAN 程序条款。此类验证将以尽量不干扰被许可方的业务的方式进行，并且可以在正常营业时间在被许可方的场所进行。IBM 可以使用独立审查员协助此类验证，但前提是 IBM 和此审查员签订适当的书面保密协议。

11.2 解决

如果任何此类验证显示被许可方对程序的使用超出其授权使用级别或者未遵守 ILAN 程序条款，那么 IBM 会书面通知被许可方。被许可方同意立即向 IBM 支付 IBM 在发票中指定的以下方面费用：1）任何此类超级别使用；2）超级别使用的期间或两年（以较短者为准）对此类超级别使用的支持；以及 3）此验证所确定的任何额外费用和其他责任。

12. 第三方声明

本程序可能包含第三方代码，这些代码由 IBM，而不是第三方，根据本协议向被许可方许可。随附的第三方代码的声明（第三方声明，如有）仅供告知被许可方。这些声明可以在程序的声明文件中找到。关于如何获取某些第三方代码的源代码的信息可以在第三方声明中找到。如果在第三方声明中，IBM 将第三方代码标识为“可修改第三方代码”，那么 IBM 授权被许可方 1）修改可修改第三方代码，以及 2）对于可修改第三方代码直接接口的程序模块进行反向工程，前提是这样做的唯一目的是为了对被许可方对此类第三方代码的修改进行调试。IBM 的服务和支持义务（如有）仅适用于未经修改的程序。

13. 一般条款

a. 本协议中的任何规定均不影响消费者拥有的，而且不得以协议形式加以限定或免除的法定权利。

b. 除非被许可方与 IBM 之间以书面形式另行约定，对于 IBM 以有形的方式提供的程序，在将此类程序交付给 IBM 指定的承运人之后，IBM 即完成了其装运和交付的义务。

c. 如果本协议的任一条款规定被认定无效或不可执行，本协议的其余条款依然继续完全有效。

d. 被许可方同意遵守所有适用的出口和进口法律及法规，包括美国禁运和制裁法规以及对出口到某些最终用户或用途的限制规定。

e. 被许可方授权国际商业机器公司（International Business Machines Corporation）及其子公司（和其继承人和受让人、承包商及 IBM 业务合作伙伴）在其开展业务的任何地方存储和使用被许可方的业务联系信息，以开展与 IBM 产品和服务相关的业务或推进 IBM 与被许可方之间的业务关系。

f. 在主张另一方未履行本协议下的义务前，一方应允许另一方有合理的机会来遵守协议。双方将努力通过友好方式解决双方之间与本协议相关的所有争议、分歧和权利主张。

g. 除非适用法律另有规定而无法约定放弃或限制，否则：1）任何一方都不会在与本协议相关的索赔诉因发生超过两年后提起任何形式的法律诉讼；以及 2）在此类时间限制过期之后任何此类索赔以及与索赔相关的所有各自的权利都将归于无效。

h. 无论是被许可方还是 IBM，均不对因其不可控制的原因而无法履行的任何义务负责。

i. 本协议没有为任何第三方设立诉讼的权利或诉因，IBM 也不对任何第三方对被许可方的索赔负责，但如以上第 10.1 子节（IBM 可能承担责任的项目）所允许的，对于IBM 应对第三方承担法律责任的人身伤害（包括死亡）或不动产或有形动产的索赔除外。

j. 签署本协议时，双方均未依赖未在本协议中规定的任何陈述，包括但不限于关于以下方面的陈述 1）程序的性能或功能外；2）其他方的经验或建议；或 3）任何被许可方可能实现的结果或可节省金额。

k. IBM 已经与某些组织（称作“IBM 业务合作伙伴”）签署协议，以推广、营销和支持某些程序。IBM 业务合作伙伴依然独立于 IBM。对于 IBM 业务合作伙伴的行为和陈述或者对被许可方的义务，IBM 不承担责任。

l. 被许可方与 IBM 的其他协议（比如 IBM 客户协议）下的许可和知识产权赔偿条款不适用于根据本协议授予的程序许可。

m. 双方同意交换的所有信息均为非保密。如果其中一方要求交换保密信息，那么将按照已签署的保密协议进行交换。

14. 地理范围和适用法律

14.1 适用法律

双方均同意，被许可方获得程序许可所在的国家或地区的法律将管辖、解释和强制执行由本协议标的引起的或以任何方式与之相关的被许可方与 IBM 的权利、责任和义务，而不考虑法律冲突原则。

若被授權人欲增加其「授權使用」，被授權人應事先通知 IBM 或 IBM 授權經銷商，並支付任何相關費用。

5. 稅金

任何主管機關對本「程式」課以稅金、公課或費用（不含對 IBM 之所得所課之稅款），被授權人同意依發票載明之金額支付，惟被授權人提供免稅文件者不在此限。自被授權人取得本「程式」之日起， 貴客戶應就該「程式」自行負責任何個人財產稅。若任何主管機構就本「程式」於原被授權人取得授權時所在國家或地區之境外，對本程式之匯入或匯出、轉讓、存取或使用課以關稅、稅捐或費用者，被授權人同意自行負責支付任何所課金額。

6. 退款保證

若被授權人因故不滿意本「程式」，且被授權人為原始被授權人，被授權人得終止本授權，並索回原已付款項，惟被授權人需於發票開立日三十天內，將本「程式」退還予本「程式」原供貨廠商。若該授權係屬可展延之固定期間授權，被授權人需於首次授權期間之前三十日內退還本「程式」，始得取回已付款項。若被授權人已下載本「程式」，被授權人應與提供本「程式」予被授權人之原供貨廠商聯絡，並依其指示以取回已付款項。

7. 程式轉讓

只有在第三人同意本合約條款時，被授權人始得轉讓本「程式」及授權之相關權利義務。任一方當事人因故終止本授權後，被授權人即不得轉讓本「程式」予他人。被授權人不得部分轉讓 1) 本「程式」，或 2) 本「程式」之「授權使用」。被授權人轉讓本程式之同時，亦應交付一份本合約之複本，包括本合約之「授權手冊」。轉讓後，被授權人取得之授權即告終止。

除依法律規定不得排除之保證外，IBM 就本程式或支援不提供任何明示或默示之保證，包括且不限於適售性、品質滿意度、符合特殊效用、所有權以及任何未涉侵權之保證。

倘法律規定不得排除明示或默示之保證，則上開除外條款不適用。在此種情況下，此等保證僅於法律要求之最短期間有效。該期間後一切保證均喪失效力。倘法律規定不得限制默示保證之有效期間，則該限制無效。根據不同國家或地區之規定，被授權人亦可能享有其他法定權利。

本第 8 節中之免責聲明與除外條款，亦適用於任何 IBM 程式開發者與供應商。

非 IBM 程式之製造商、供應商或發佈者得提供其自已之保證。

IBM 不提供任何類型之技術支援，但 IBM 另有指明者不在此限。如有指明，IBM 所提供之任何技術支援受本第 8 節中之免責聲明及除外條款拘束。

9. 被授權人之資料與資料庫

為協助被授權人區隔本「程式」所致問題之成因，IBM 得要求被授權人 1) 允許 IBM 以遠端方式存取被授權人之系統，或 2) 傳送被授權人之資訊或系統資料至 IBM。IBM 並無義務提供前項協助，惟 IBM 與被授權人另立個別書面合約，且 IBM 依該合約同意為被授權人提供本合約規定義務以外之支援類型者，不在此限。 IBM 應使用錯誤與問題相關資訊以改進其產品與服務，並協助提供相關之支援供應項目。基於此等目的，IBM 得利用其他 IBM 實體與轉包商（包括位於被授權人所在國家或地區以外之一或多個國家或地區之該等實體與轉包商），且被授權人在此授權 IBM 此等運用行為。

惟就下列事項，被授權人仍應自行負責：1) 被授權人提供予 IBM 之任何資料及任何資料庫之內容；2) 選擇及實施有關資料之存取、安全、加密、使用及傳輸之程序與控管（包括任何可辨識個人身分之資料）；及 3) 備份及回復任何資料庫及任何儲存資料。被授權人不得傳送任何可辨識個人身分之數據資料或其他類型資料，或提供該等資訊之存取權限予 IBM。被授權人因其錯誤提供該等資訊予 IBM 之情事，致使 IBM 因遺失或揭露該等資訊所衍生合理費用及其他款項，包括因任何第三人之索賠所生費用及款項，應由被授權人負責。

10. 賠償上限

本第 10 節（「賠償上限」）中之限制與除外條款，除法律規定不得以契約限制之情況外，其他情況一律適用。

10.1 IBM 應負責賠償之項目

因 IBM 違約或其他可歸責事由，被授權人得向 IBM 請求損害賠償。IBM 就各「程式」本身所發生或相關之全部請求或其他基於本合約所生之請求，無論被授權人基於何種權利請求賠償（包括重大違約、疏忽、不實陳述或其他契約請求或侵權行為），IBM 之賠償責任僅限於 1) 人身傷害（包括死亡）之損害、不動產或個人有形資產之毀損；2) 其他直接實際損害，惟不得超過被授權人就該「程式」所支付之授權費用（若該「程式」為定期付費者，則以十二個月之授權費用為上限）。

此項限制亦適用於任何 IBM 之「程式」開發者與供應商。此項限制係 IBM 及 IBM 之「程式」開發者與供應商之共同賠償上限。

10.2 IBM 毋需負責賠償之項目

在任何情況下，IBM、IBM 之「程式」開發者或供應商對下列情事均不負賠償責任，即使被告知該情事有可能發生時，亦同：

a. 資料之滅失或毀損；

b. 特殊損害、附帶損害、懲罰性損害、間接損害或任何衍生性經濟損害；或

c. 所失利益、利潤、營業、收益、商譽或預期結餘等項之損失。

本第 11 節所規定之權利義務，於任何本「程式」授權期間及其後二年內有效。

11.1 查核程序

被授權人同意製作、保留以下各項資料並將其提供予本公司及稽核員：正確之書面記錄、系統工具輸出及其他必要系統資訊，以查核被授權人使用一切「程式」時是否遵守 ILAN 程式條款（包括 IBM 之授權及計價條款）。被授權人就下列事項負責：1) 確保未逾其授權使用之範圍；及 2) 遵從 ILAN 程式條款。

IBM 得於合理之通知後，查核被授權人於一切地點或環境基於任何目的使用受 ILAN 程式條款拘束之「程式」時是否遵循 ILAN 程式條款。該項查核，將以較不干擾被授權人業務之方式為之，並得於被授權人之正常上班時間內，在被授權人所在處所為之。IBM 得請求獨立稽核員協助進行該項查核，惟 IBM 應與該稽核員訂立適當之書面保密合約。

11.2 紛爭解決

如該項查核指出被授權人使用本「程式」逾越其授權使用範圍或未遵守 ILAN 程式條款者，IBM 將以書面通知被授權人。被授權人同意立即支付 IBM 於發票載明之下列費用：1) 逾越授權使用範圍之任何使用行為之應付費用；2) 逾越授權使用範圍之使用期間所應支付之程式支援費用，惟最高不得超過二年；及 3) 因查核所致生之附加費用及其他賠償責任。

12. 第三人注意事項

本「程式」可能內含第三人程式碼，該程式碼係由 IBM（而非第三人）依本合約提供授權予被授權人。檢附之第三人程式碼注意事項（「第三人注意事項」）僅供被授權人參考之用。該等注意事項可於本「程式」之 NOTICES 檔中找到。有關如何取得某些第三人程式碼之資訊，可於「第三人注意事項」中找到。若 IBM 於「第三人注意事項」中指出第三人程式碼為「可修改第三人程式碼」，則 IBM 授予被授權人下列權利：1) 修改「可修改第三人程式碼」及 2) 對直接連結「可修改第三人程式碼」之「程式」模組進行還原工程，惟被授權人僅得基於就該第三人程式碼所為修改之除錯目的而為之。IBM 之服務與支援義務，僅適用於未修改之「程式」。
